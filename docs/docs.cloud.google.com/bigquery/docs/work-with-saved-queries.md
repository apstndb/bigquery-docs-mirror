# Create saved queries

When you write SQL in the query editor, you can save your query and share your query with others. Saved queries are [BigQuery Studio](/bigquery/docs/query-overview#bigquery-studio) code assets powered by [Dataform](/dataform/docs/overview) .

For more information on deleting saved queries and managing saved query history, see [Manage saved queries](/bigquery/docs/manage-saved-queries) .

## Required permissions

Set the appropriate permissions to create, edit, or view saved queries.

All users with the [Dataform Admin role](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.admin) ( `  roles/dataform.admin  ` ) have owner access to all saved queries created in the project.

For more information about BigQuery Identity and Access Management (IAM), see [Access control with IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

### Permissions to create saved queries

To create and run saved queries, you need the following IAM permissions:

  - `  dataform.locations.get  `

  - `  dataform.locations.list  `

  - `  dataform.repositories.list  `

  - `  dataform.repositories.create  `
    
    **Note:** Users who have the `  dataform.repositories.create  ` permission can execute code using the default Dataform service account and all permissions granted to that service account. For more information, see [Security considerations for Dataform permissions](/dataform/docs/access-control#security-considerations-permissions) .

You can get these permissions from the following IAM roles:

  - [BigQuery Job User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` )
  - [BigQuery Read Session User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.readSessionUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.readSessionUser  ` )
  - [Code Creator](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeCreator) ( `  roles/dataform.codeCreator  ` )

**Warning:** Visibility for code assets is governed by project-level Dataform permissions. Users with the `  dataform.repositories.list  ` permission—which is included in standard BigQuery roles such as [BigQuery Job User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) , [BigQuery Studio User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.studioUser) , and [BigQuery User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.user) —can see all code assets in the **Explorer** panel of the Google Cloud project, regardless of whether they created these assets or these assets were shared with them. To restrict visibility, you can create [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) that exclude the `  dataform.repositories.list  ` permission.

**Note:** Users assigned the Code Creator role in a project can list the names of code assets in that project by using the Dataform API or the Dataform command-line interface (CLI).

**Note:** When you create a saved query, BigQuery grants you the [Dataform Admin role](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.admin) ( `  roles/dataform.admin  ` ) on that saved query. All users with the Dataform Admin role granted on the Google Cloud project have owner access to all the saved queries created in the project. To override this behavior, see [Grant a specific role upon resource creation](/dataform/docs/access-control#grant-specific-role) .

### Permissions to edit saved queries

To edit and run saved queries, you need the following IAM roles:

  - [BigQuery Job User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` )
  - [BigQuery Read Session User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.readSessionUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.readSessionUser  ` )
  - [Code Editor](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeEditor) ( `  roles/dataform.codeEditor  ` )

### Permissions to view saved queries

To view and run saved queries, you need the following IAM roles:

  - [BigQuery Job User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` )
  - [BigQuery Read Session User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.readSessionUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.readSessionUser  ` )
  - [Code Viewer](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeViewer) ( `  roles/dataform.codeViewer  ` )

## Set the default region for code assets

If this is the first time you are creating a code asset, you should set the default region for code assets. You can't change the region for a code asset after it is created.

**Note:** If you create a saved query and choose a different default region than the one you have been using for code assets, for example choosing `  us-west1  ` when you have been using `  us-central1  ` , then that query and all code assets you create afterwards use that new region by default. Existing code assets continue to use the region they were assigned when they were created.

All code assets in BigQuery Studio use the same default region. To set the default region for code assets, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, find the project in which you have enabled code assets.

3.  Click more\_vert **View actions** next to the project, and then click **Change my default code region** .

4.  For **Region** , select the region that you want to use for code assets.

5.  Click **Select** .

For a list of supported regions, see [BigQuery Studio locations](/bigquery/docs/locations#bqstudio-loc) .

## Create saved queries

To create a saved query, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  Click add\_box **SQL query** .

3.  In the query editor, enter a valid SQL query. For example, you can query a [public dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      name,
      SUM(number) AS total
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013`
    GROUP BY
      name
    ORDER BY
      total DESC
    LIMIT
      10;
    ```
    
    Alternatively, you can use the [**Reference** panel](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#use-reference-panel) to construct new queries.

4.  Click **Save \> Save query** or press Control+S (or Command+S on macOS).

5.  In the **Save query** dialog, type a name for the saved query.

6.  Optional: To change the region used by this saved query and all other code assets in the future, select a new region in the **Region** field.

7.  Click **Save** .
    
    The first version of the saved query is created.

8.  Optional: After you save the query, use the following toolbar to view the query details or the [version history](#open_a_saved_query_version_as_a_new_query) , add new comments, or reply to or get a link to an existing comment:
    
    The **Comments** toolbar feature is in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) . To provide feedback or request support for this feature, send an email to <bqui-workspace-pod@google.com> .

## Share saved queries

To share a saved query with a user, you first grant that user access to the saved query and add them to an appropriate IAM role. Then you generate a link to the saved query and share that link with the user.

Users that you share a query with only see the most recent version of a query. Autosaved changes that you haven't explicitly saved don't appear in the shared query.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Queries** .

4.  Find and click the saved query that you want to grant access to. You can use the search feature or filters to find your query.

5.  Click person\_add **Share** , and then click **Manage permissions** .

6.  In the **Manage permissions** pane, click **Add user/group** .

7.  In the **New principals** field, enter a principal.

8.  In the **Role** list, select one of the following roles:
    
      - [**Code Owner**](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeOwner) : can perform any action on the saved query, including deleting or sharing it.
      - [**Code Editor**](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeEditor) : can edit the query.
      - [**Code Viewer**](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeViewer) : can view the query.
    
    **Note:** The principal must also have the [BigQuery User ( `  roles/bigquery.user  ` )](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.user) role to run the saved query.

9.  Optional: To view a complete list of roles and advanced sharing settings, click **Advanced sharing** .

10. Click **Save** .

11. To return to the saved query info, click **Close** .

12. To generate a link to the saved query, click person\_add **Share** , and then click **Get link** .
    
    The link is copied to your clipboard.

## Open a saved query version as a new query

To open any version of an existing saved query as a new query, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Queries** .

4.  Select a saved query. You can use the search feature or filters to find your query.

5.  Click history **Version history** .

6.  Click more\_vert **View actions** next to a saved query version and then click **Open as new query** .

## Update saved queries

Changes that you make to the text of a saved query are automatically saved two seconds after you stop typing and appear in your **Version history** as **Your changes** . Autosaved changes aren't a new version of the query. Your autosaved changes reappear any time you open the query but aren't visible to anyone else unless you explicitly save them as a new [version](/bigquery/docs/manage-saved-queries#work_with_saved_query_versions) of the query. Autosaved queries are in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Queries** .

4.  Select a saved query. You can use the search feature or filters to find your query.

5.  Modify the query.

6.  To save the modified query, click **Save query \> Save query** or press Control+S (or Command+S on macOS).
    
    A new version of the query is created.

## Upload saved queries

You can upload a local SQL query to use it as a saved query in BigQuery Studio. The uploaded saved query is then also visible in the BigQuery page of the Google Cloud console.

To upload a saved query, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, and then do one of the following:
    
      - Next to **Queries** , click more\_vert **View actions** \> **Upload SQL query** .
      - Next to the Google Cloud project name, click more\_vert **View actions** \> **Upload to project** \> **SQL query** .

4.  In the **Upload SQL** dialog, in the **SQL** field, click **Browse** , and then select the query that you want to upload.

5.  Optional: In the **SQL name** field, edit the name of the query.

6.  In the **Region** field, select the region where you want to upload your saved query.

7.  Click **Upload** .

Your saved query can be accessed through the **Explorer** pane.

## Classic saved queries

**Deprecated:** Saved queries, available in [BigQuery Studio](/bigquery/docs/enable-assets) , will fully replace classic saved queries in the future. The deprecation timeline is being reviewed. For more information, see [Deprecation of classic saved queries](/bigquery/docs/saved-queries-introduction#classic-saved-queries-deprecation) . To learn how to migrate to saved queries, see [Migrate classic saved queries](/bigquery/docs/manage-saved-queries#migrate_classic_saved_queries) .

Use the following sections to learn how to create and update [classic saved queries](/bigquery/docs/saved-queries-introduction#classic_saved_queries) . For more information on sharing, migrating, and deleting classic saved queries, see [Classic saved queries](/bigquery/docs/manage-saved-queries#classic_saved_queries) .

**Note:** If you have not enabled BigQuery Studio, classic saved queries appear in the **Saved queries ( NUMBER )** folder in the **Classic explorer** pane instead of the **(Classic) Queries** folder.

### Required permissions for classic saved queries

The following IAM permissions are required to create, view, update, and delete classic saved queries:

  - **Private** classic saved queries:
      - Creating private classic saved queries requires no special permissions. You can save a private query in any project, but only you can view, update, or delete the query.
  - **Project-level** classic saved queries:
      - **Creating** a project-level classic saved query requires `  bigquery.savedqueries.create  ` permissions. The `  bigquery.admin  ` predefined role includes `  bigquery.savedqueries.create  ` permissions.
      - **Viewing** a project-level classic saved query requires `  bigquery.savedqueries.get  ` and `  bigquery.savedqueries.list  ` permissions. The `  bigquery.admin  ` and `  bigquery.user  ` predefined roles include `  bigquery.savedqueries.get  ` and `  bigquery.savedqueries.list  ` permissions.
      - **Updating** a project-level classic saved query requires `  bigquery.savedqueries.update  ` permissions. The `  bigquery.admin  ` predefined role includes `  bigquery.savedqueries.update  ` permissions.
      - **Deleting** a project-level classic saved query requires `  bigquery.savedqueries.delete  ` permissions. The `  bigquery.admin  ` predefined role includes `  bigquery.savedqueries.delete  ` permissions.
  - **Public** classic saved queries:
      - Creating public classic saved queries requires no special permissions. You can save a public classic saved query in any project, but only you can update or delete the query. Anyone with the link can view a public classic saved query.

**Note:** Users given the `  dataform.repository.list  ` permission at the project level can see all saved queries created in the project.

For more information on IAM roles in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

### Create classic saved queries

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  Click add\_box **SQL query** .

3.  In the query editor, enter a valid SQL query. For example, you can query a [public dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data) :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      name,
      SUM(number) AS total
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013`
    GROUP BY
      name
    ORDER BY
      total DESC
    LIMIT
      10;
    ```

4.  Click **Save Query (Classic) \> Save query (Classic)** .

5.  In the **Save query** dialog, enter a name for your query, and then set **Visibility** to one of the following options:
    
      - **Personal (editable only by you)** for a private clasic shared query.
      - **Project (editable by principals with appropriate permissions)** for a project-level classic saved query.
      - **Public** for a public classic saved query.

6.  Click **Save** .

### Share classic saved queries

You can share classic saved queries that you have given project or public visibility. Project visibility allows principals with the [required permissions](/bigquery/docs/work-with-saved-queries#required_permissions_for_classic_saved_queries) to view, update, or delete the query. Public visibility allows anyone with the query link to view but not update or delete the query.

You share a classic saved query with other users by generating and sharing a link to the classic saved query.

To run a classic shared query, users must have access to the data that the query accesses. For more information, see [Grant access to a dataset](/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam#grant_access_to_a_dataset) .

If you are plan to share a classic saved query, consider including a comment in the query that describes its purpose.

1.  In the left pane, click category **Classic Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

2.  In the **Classic Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **(Classic) Queries** , and then find the classic saved query you want to share.

3.  Click more\_vert **View actions** next to the query and then click **Get link** .

4.  Share the link with the users you want to grant access to the query.

### Update classic saved queries

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click category **Classic Explorer** :

3.  In the **Classic Explorer** pane, expand your project and the **(Classic) Queries** folder, and if necessary, the **Project queries** folder.

4.  Click the name of a classic saved query to open it.

5.  Modify the query.

6.  To save the modified query, click **Save Query (Classic) \> Save query (Classic)** .
