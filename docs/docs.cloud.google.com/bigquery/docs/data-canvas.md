# Analyze with BigQuery data canvas

This document describes how to use data canvas for data analysis. You can also manage data canvas metadata by using [Dataplex Universal Catalog](/dataplex/docs/introduction) .

BigQuery data canvas, which is a [Gemini in BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/gemini-overview) feature, lets you find, transform, query, and visualize data by using natural language prompts and a graphic interface for analysis workflows.

For analysis workflows, BigQuery data canvas uses a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG), which provides a graphical view of your workflow. In BigQuery data canvas, you can iterate on query results and work with multiple branches of inquiry in a single place.

BigQuery data canvas is designed to accelerate analytics tasks and help data professionals such as data analysts, data engineers, and others with their data-to-insights journey. It doesn't require that you have technical knowledge of specific tools, only basic familiarity with reading and writing SQL. BigQuery data canvas works with [Dataplex Universal Catalog](/dataplex/docs/introduction) metadata to identify appropriate tables based on natural language.

BigQuery data canvas isn't intended for direct use by business users.

BigQuery data canvas uses Gemini in BigQuery to find your data, create SQL, generate charts, and create data summaries.

Learn [how and when Gemini for Google Cloud uses your data](/gemini/docs/discover/data-governance) .

## Capabilities

BigQuery data canvas lets you do the following:

  - Use natural language queries or [keyword search syntax](/data-catalog/docs/how-to/search-reference) with Dataplex Universal Catalog metadata to find assets such as tables, views, or materialized views.

  - Use natural language for basic SQL queries such as the following:
    
      - Queries that contain `  FROM  ` clauses, math functions, arrays, and structs.
      - `  JOIN  ` operations for two tables.

  - Create custom visualizations by using natural language to describe what you want.

  - Automate data insights.

## Limitations

  - Natural language commands might not work well with the following:
    
      - BigQuery ML
      - Apache Spark
      - Object tables
      - BigLake
      - `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` views
      - JSON
      - Nested and repeated fields
      - Complex functions and data types such as `  DATETIME  ` and `  TIMEZONE  `

  - Data visualizations don't work with geomap charts.

## Prompting best practices

With the right prompting techniques, you can generate complex SQL queries. The following suggestions help BigQuery data canvas refine your natural language prompts to increase the accuracy of your queries:

  - **Write with clarity.** State your request clearly and avoid being vague.

  - **Ask direct questions.** For the most precise answer, ask one question at a time, and keep your prompts concise. If you initially gave a prompt with more than one question, itemize each distinct part of the question so that it's clear to Gemini.

  - **Give focused and explicit instructions.** Emphasize key terms in your prompts.

  - **Specify the order of operations.** Provide instructions in a clear and ordered manner. Divide tasks into small, focused steps.

  - **Refine and iterate.** Try different phrases and approaches to see what yields the best results.

For more information, see [Prompting best practices for BigQuery data canvas](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/how-to-write-prompts-for-bigquery-data-canvas) .

## Before you begin

1.  [Ensure that Gemini in BigQuery is enabled for your Google Cloud project.](/bigquery/docs/gemini-set-up) An administrator typically performs this step.
2.  Ensure that you have the [necessary Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions](#required-roles) to use BigQuery data canvas.
3.  To manage data canvas metadata in Dataplex Universal Catalog, ensure that the [Dataplex API](/dataplex/docs/enable-api) is enabled in your Google Cloud project.

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to use BigQuery data canvas, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project:

  - [BigQuery Studio User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.studioUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.studioUser  ` )
  - [Gemini for Google Cloud User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudaicompanion#cloudaicompanion.user) ( `  roles/cloudaicompanion.user  ` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information about IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see [Introduction to IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

To manage data canvas metadata in Dataplex Universal Catalog, ensure that you have the required [Dataplex Universal Catalog roles](/dataplex/docs/iam-roles) and the [`  dataform.repositories.get  `](/dataform/docs/access-control#predefined-roles) permission.

**Note:** When you create a data canvas, BigQuery grants you the [Dataform Admin role](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.admin) ( `  roles/dataform.admin  ` ) on that data canvas. All users with the Dataform Admin role granted on the Google Cloud project have owner access to all the data canvases created in the project. To override this behavior, see [Grant a specific role upon resource creation](/dataform/docs/access-control#grant-specific-role) .

## Node types

A canvas is a collection of one or more nodes. Nodes can be connected in any order. BigQuery data canvas has the following node types:

  - Text
  - Search
  - Table
  - SQL
  - Destination node
  - Visualization
  - Insights

### Text node

In BigQuery data canvas, a text node lets you add rich text content to your canvas. It's useful for adding explanations, notes, or instructions to your canvas, making it easier for you and others to understand the context and purpose of your analysis. You can enter any text content you want into the text node editor, including Markdown for formatting. This ability lets you create visually appealing and informative text blocks.

From the text node, you can do the following:

  - Delete the node.
  - Debug the node.
  - Duplicate the node.

### Search node

In BigQuery data canvas, a search node lets you find and incorporate data assets into your canvas. It acts as a bridge between your natural language queries or keyword searches and the actual data you want to work with.

You provide a search query, either with natural language or using keywords. The search node searches through your data assets. It leverages Dataplex Universal Catalog metadata for enhanced context awareness. BigQuery data canvas also suggests recently used tables, queries, and saved queries.

The search node returns a list of relevant data assets that match your query. It factors in column names and table descriptions. You can then select the assets you want to add to your data canvas as table nodes, where you can further analyze and visualize the data.

From the search node, you can do the following:

  - Delete the node.
  - Debug the node.
  - Duplicate the node.

### Table node

In BigQuery data canvas, a table node represents a specific table that you've incorporated into your analysis workflow. It represents the data you're working with and lets you interact with it directly.

A table node displays information about the table, such as its name, schema, and a preview of the data. You can interact with the table by viewing details such as the table schema, table details, and a table preview.

From the table node, you can do the following:

  - Delete the node.
  - Debug the node.
  - Duplicate the node.
  - Run the node.
  - Run the node and the following node.

Within the data canvas, you can do the following:

  - Query the results in a new SQL node.
  - Join the results to another table.

### SQL node

In BigQuery data canvas, a SQL node lets you execute custom SQL queries directly within your canvas. You can either write SQL code directly in the SQL node editor or use a natural language prompt to generate the SQL.

The SQL node executes the provided SQL query against the specified data sources. The SQL node produces a result table, which can then be connected to other nodes in the canvas for further analysis or visualization. The outputs from the execution of a SQL node, known as the *query result* , can also be persisted to their own table through a *destination node* .

After the query has run, you can export it as a [scheduled query](/bigquery/docs/scheduling-queries) , [export the query results](/bigquery/docs/export-file) , or [share](/bigquery/docs/work-with-saved-queries#share-saved-query) the canvas, similar to [running an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

From the SQL node, you can do the following:

  - Export the SQL statement as a scheduled query.
  - Delete the node.
  - Debug the node.
  - Duplicate the node.
  - Run the node.
  - Run the node and the following node.

Within the data canvas, you can do the following:

  - Query the results in a new SQL node.
  - Save the results to a table.
  - Visualize the results in a visualization node.
  - Generate insights on the results in an insights node.
  - Join the results to another table.

### Destination node

In BigQuery data canvas, a destination node is a child of a SQL node that persists the result of a SQL execution to a dedicated table. You can save the table in a new or existing dataset, or as a new or existing table in a dataset. After a destination table is created, use the SQL toggle button to keep the table updated in real time when the parent SQL node is re-executed.

A destination node can become a table node when it's detached from its parent and the content of the table isn't affected by any upstream changes at the parent SQL node.

From the destination node, you can do the following:

  - Detach the node from the parent to make it a standalone table node.
  - Query the table in a new SQL node.
  - Join the results to another table.

### Visualization node

In BigQuery data canvas, a visualization node lets you display data visually, making it easier to understand trends, patterns, and insights. It provides a variety of chart types to choose from, letting you select and customize the best visualization for your data.

A visualization node takes a table as input, which can be the result of a SQL query or a table node. Based on the selected chart type and the data in the input table, the visualization node generates a chart. You can select **Auto-Chart** to let BigQuery select the best chart type for your data. The visualization node then displays the generated chart.

The visualization node lets you customize your chart, including changing the colors, labels, and data sources. You can also export the chart as a PNG file.

Visualize data by using the following graphic types:

  - Bar chart
  - Heat map
  - Line graph
  - Pie chart
  - Scatter chart

From the visualization node, you can do the following:

  - Export the chart as a PNG file.
  - Debug the node.
  - Duplicate the node.
  - Run the node.
  - Run the node and the following node.

Within the data canvas, you can do the following:

  - Generate insights on the results in an insights node.
  - Edit the visualization.

### Insights node

In BigQuery data canvas, an insights node lets you generate insights and summaries from the data within your data canvas. This helps you uncover patterns, assess data quality, and perform statistical analysis on your canvas. It identifies trends, patterns, anomalies, and correlations within your data, as well as generates concise and clear summaries of the data analysis results.

For more information about data insights, see [Generate data insights in BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/data-insights) .

From the insights node, you can do the following:

  - Delete the node.
  - Duplicate the node.
  - Run the node.

### Advanced analysis (Python node) (Deprecated)

Advanced analysis, also called a Python node, is a [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) feature.

This feature is now deprecated. To continue using your canvas, [export your query to a notebook](/bigquery/docs/data-canvas#export-notebook) .

## Use BigQuery data canvas

You can use BigQuery data canvas in the Google Cloud console, a query, or a table.

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, next to add\_box **SQL query** , click arrow\_drop\_down **Create new** , and then click **Data canvas** .

3.  In the **Natural language** prompt field, enter a natural language prompt.
    
    For example, if you enter `  Find me tables related to trees  ` , BigQuery data canvas returns a list of possible tables, including public datasets like `  bigquery-public-data.usfs_fia.plot_tree  ` or `  bigquery-public-data.new_york_trees.tree_species  ` .

4.  Select a table.
    
    A table node for the selected table is added to BigQuery data canvas. To view schema information, view table details, or preview the data, select the various tabs in the table node.

5.  Optional: After you save the data canvas, use the following toolbar to view data canvas details or the [version history](#view_and_compare_data_canvas_versions) , add new comments, or reply to or get a link to an existing comment:
    
    The **Comments** toolbar feature is in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) . To provide feedback or request support for this feature, send an email to <bqui-workspace-pod@google.com> .

### Canvas controls

The data canvas toolbar provides the following controls for adding nodes and managing the canvas view:

  - **Search** : Adds a search node to the canvas.
  - **SQL** : Adds a SQL node to the canvas.
  - **Text** : Adds a Markdown or text node for comments.
  - **Zoom controls** : Let you set a specific zoom level.
  - **Zoom to Fit** : Automatically adjusts the zoom to show all content on the canvas.

  - **Refresh canvas** : Runs all executable nodes with a single button.
  - **More actions** : Opens additional options, such as clearing the canvas.

The following examples demonstrate different ways to use BigQuery data canvas in analysis workflows.

### Example workflow: Find, query, and visualize data

In this example, you use natural language prompts in BigQuery data canvas to find data, generate a query, and edit the query. Then, you create a chart.

#### Prompt 1: Find data

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, next to add\_box **SQL query** , click arrow\_drop\_down **Create new** , and then click **Data canvas** .

3.  Click **Search for data** .

4.  Click filter\_list **Edit search filters** , and then, in the **Filter search** pane, click the **BigQuery public datasets** toggle to the on position.

5.  In the **Natural language** prompt field, enter the following natural language prompt:
    
    ``` text
    Chicago taxi trips
    ```
    
    BigQuery data canvas generates a list of potential tables based on Dataplex Universal Catalog metadata. You can select multiple tables.

6.  Select `  bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips  ` table, and then click **Add to canvas** .
    
    A table node for `  taxi_trips  ` is added to BigQuery data canvas. To view schema information, view table details, or preview the data, select the various tabs in the table node.

#### Prompt 2: Generate a SQL query in the selected table

As an early-stage technology, Gemini for Google Cloud products can generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. We recommend that you validate all output from Gemini for Google Cloud products before you use it. For more information, see [Gemini for Google Cloud and responsible AI](/gemini/docs/discover/responsible-ai) .

To generate a SQL query for the `  bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips  ` table, do the following:

1.  In the data canvas, click **Query** .

2.  In the **Natural language** prompt field, enter the following:
    
    ``` text
    Get me the 100 longest trips
    ```
    
    BigQuery data canvas generates a SQL query similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      taxi_id,
      trip_start_timestamp,
      trip_end_timestamp,
      trip_miles
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.chicago_taxi_trips.taxi_trips`
    ORDER BY
      trip_miles DESC
    LIMIT
      100;
    ```

#### Prompt 3: Edit the query

To edit the query that you generated, you can manually edit the query, or you can change the natural language prompt and regenerate the query. In this example, you use a natural language prompt to edit the query to select only trips where the customer paid with cash.

1.  In the **Natural language** prompt field, enter the following:
    
    ``` text
    Get me the 100 longest trips where the payment type is cash
    ```
    
    BigQuery data canvas generates a SQL query similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      taxi_id,
      trip_start_timestamp,
      trip_end_timestamp,
      trip_miles
    FROM
      `PROJECT_ID.chicago_taxi_trips_123123.taxi_trips`
    WHERE
      payment_type = 'Cash'
    ORDER BY
      trip_miles DESC
    LIMIT
      100;
    ```
    
    In the preceding example, `  PROJECT_ID  ` is the ID of your Google Cloud project.

2.  To view the results of the query, click **Run** .

#### Create a chart

1.  In the data canvas, click **Visualize** .

2.  Click **Create bar chart** .
    
    BigQuery data canvas creates a bar chart showing the most trip miles by trip ID. Along with providing a chart, BigQuery data canvas summarizes some of the key details of the data backing the visualization.

3.  Optional: Do one or more of the following:
    
      - To modify the chart, click **Edit** , and then edit the chart in the **Edit visualization** pane.
      - To share the data canvas, click **Share** , then click **Share Link** to copy BigQuery data canvas link.
      - To clean up the data canvas, select more\_vert **More actions** , and then select gavel **Clear canvas** . This step results in a blank canvas.

You can continue to make natural language prompts as you work with your data canvas.

### Add data

When you work with the Gemini chat interface, you can add data so that the assistant knows which dataset to reference. The assistant asks you to select a table before you run any prompts. When you search for data within the assistant, you can limit the scope of the searchable data to all projects, starred projects, or your current project. You can also decide whether to include public datasets in your search.

To add data to the Gemini assistant, do the following:

1.  To open the assistant, on the data canvas, click spark **Open Data Canvas Assistant** .
2.  Click **Settings** , and then click **Add Data** .
3.  Optional: To expand the search results to include public datasets, click the **Public datasets** toggle to the on position.
4.  Optional: To change the scope of the search results to different projects, select the appropriate project option from the **Scope** menu.
5.  Select the checkbox for each of the tables that you want to add to the assistant.
    1.  To search for tables that aren't suggested by the assistant, click **Search for tables** .
    2.  In the **Natural language** prompt field, enter a prompt describing what table you are looking for, and then press Enter .
    3.  Select the checkbox for each of the tables you want to add to the assistant, and then click **Ok** .
6.  Close the **Canvas assistant settings** pane.

The assistant bases its analysis on the data you choose.

### Add instructions

When you work with the Gemini chat interface, you can add instructions so that the assistant knows how to behave. These instructions are applied to all prompts within the data canvas. Examples of potential instructions include the following:

  - `  Visualize trends over time.  `
  - `  Chart colors: Red (negative), Green (positive)  `
  - `  Domain: USA  `

To add instructions to the assistant, do the following:

1.  To open the assistant, on the data canvas, click spark **Open Data Canvas Assistant** .
2.  Click **Settings** .
3.  In the **Instructions** field, add a list of your instructions for the assistant, and then close the **Canvas assistant settings** pane.

The assistant remembers the instructions and applies them to future prompts.

### Gemini assistant best practices

To get the best results when working with the BigQuery data canvas assistant, follow these best practices:

  - **Be specific and unambiguous.** Clearly state what you want to calculate, analyze, or visualize. For example, instead of `  Analyze trip data  ` , say `  Calculate the average trip duration for trips starting in council district eight  ` .

  - **Ensure accurate data context.** The assistant can only work with the data you provide. Ensure all relevant tables and columns have been added to the canvas.

  - **Start simply, then iterate.** Begin with a straightforward question to ensure the assistant understands the basic structure and data. For example, first say `  Show total trips by subscriber_type  ` , and then say `  Show total trips by subscriber_type  ` and break down the result by `  council_district  ` .

  - **Break down complex questions.** For multi-step processes, consider phrasing your prompt clearly with distinct parts, or using separate prompts for each major step. For example, say `  First, find the top five busiest stations by trip count. Second, calculate the average trip duration for trips starting from only those top five stations  ` .

  - **Clearly state calculations.** Specify the chosen calculation, such as `  SUM  ` , `  MAX  ` , or `  AVERAGE  ` . For example, say `  Find the MAX  ` trip duration per `  bike_id  ` .

  - **Use system instructions for persistent context and preferences.** Use [system instructions](#add_instructions) to state information rules, and preferences that apply across all prompts.

  - **Review the canvas.** Always review the generated nodes to verify that the logic aligns with your request and the results are accurate.

  - **Experiment.** Try different phrasing, levels of detail, and prompt structures to learn how the assistant responds to your specific data and analytical needs.

  - **Reference column names.** Whenever possible, use the actual column names from your selected data. For example, instead of `  Show trips by subscriber type  ` , say `  Show the count of trips grouped by subscriber_type  ` and `  start_station_name  ` .

### Example workflow: Work with a Gemini assistant

In this example, you use natural language prompts with the Gemini assistant to find, query, and visualize data.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, next to add\_box **SQL query** , click arrow\_drop\_down **Create new** , and then click **Data canvas** .

3.  Click **Search for data** .

4.  Click filter\_list **Edit search filters** , and then, in the **Filter search** pane, click the **BigQuery public datasets** toggle to the on position.

5.  In the **Natural language** prompt field, enter the following natural language prompt:
    
    ``` text
    bikeshare
    ```
    
    BigQuery data canvas generates a list of potential tables based on Dataplex Universal Catalog metadata. You can select multiple tables.

6.  Select `  bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations  ` table and `  bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips  ` , and then click **Add to canvas** .
    
    A table node for each of the selected tables is added to BigQuery data canvas. To view schema information, view table details, or preview the data, select the various tabs in the table node.

7.  To open the assistant, on the data canvas, click spark **Open Data Canvas Assistant** .

8.  Click **Settings** .

9.  In the **Instructions** field, add the following instructions for the assistant:
    
    ``` text
    Tasks:
      - Visualize findings with charts
      - Show many charts per question
      - Make sure to cover each part via a separate line of reasoning
    ```

10. Close the **Canvas assistant settings** pane.

11. In the **Ask a data question** field, enter the following natural language prompt:
    
    ``` text
    Show the number of trips by council district and subscriber type
    ```

12. You can continue to enter prompts in the **Ask a data question** field. Enter the following natural language prompt:
    
    ``` text
    What are most popular stations among the top 5 subscriber types
    ```

13. Enter the final prompt:
    
    ``` text
    What station is least used to start and end a trip
    ```
    
    Once you've asked all of the relevant prompts, your canvas is populated with the relevant query and visualization nodes according to the prompts and instructions you gave the assistant. Continue to enter prompts or modify existing prompts to get the results you are looking for.

## Work with data canvas versions

You can choose to create a data canvas either inside of or outside of a [repository](/bigquery/docs/repository-intro) . Data canvas versioning is handled differently based on where the data canvas is located.

### Data canvas versioning in repositories

Repositories are Git repositories that reside either in BigQuery or with a third-party provider. You can use [workspaces](/bigquery/docs/workspaces-intro) in repositories to perform version control on data canvases. For more information, see [Use version control with a file](/bigquery/docs/workspaces#use_version_control_with_a_file) .

### Data canvas versioning outside of repositories

You can view, compare, and restore versions of a data canvas.

#### View and compare data canvas versions

To view different versions of a data canvas and compare them with the current version, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Data canvases** .

4.  Click the name of the data canvas that you want to view version history for.

5.  Click schedule **Version history** to see a list of the data canvas versions in descending order by date.

6.  Click more\_vert **View actions** next to a data canvas version and then click **Compare** . The comparison pane opens, comparing the data canvas version that you selected with the current data canvas version.

7.  Optional: To compare the versions inline instead of in separate panes, click **Compare** and then click **Inline** .

#### Restore a data canvas version

Restoring from the comparison pane lets you compare the previous version of the data canvas to the current version before choosing whether to restore it.

1.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Data canvases** .

3.  Click the name of the data canvas that you want to restore a previous version of.

4.  Click schedule **Version history** .

5.  Click more\_vert **View actions** next to the version of the data canvas that you want to restore, and then click **Compare** .
    
    The comparison pane opens, comparing the data canvas version that you selected with the most recent data canvas version.

6.  To restore the previous data canvas version after comparison, click **Restore** .

7.  Click **Confirm** .

## Manage metadata in Dataplex Universal Catalog

[Dataplex Universal Catalog](/dataplex/docs/introduction) lets you view and manage metadata for data canvases. Data canvases are available in Dataplex Universal Catalog by default, without additional configuration.

You can use Dataplex Universal Catalog to manage data canvases in all [BigQuery locations](/bigquery/docs/locations) . Managing data canvases in Dataplex Universal Catalog is subject to [Dataplex Universal Catalog quotas and limits](/dataplex/docs/quotas) and [Dataplex Universal Catalog pricing](https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/pricing) .

Dataplex Universal Catalog automatically retrieves the following metadata from data canvases:

  - Data asset name
  - Data asset parent
  - Data asset location
  - Data asset type
  - Corresponding Google Cloud project

Dataplex Universal Catalog logs data canvases as [entries](/dataplex/docs/ingest-custom-sources#entries) with the following entry values:

  - System entry group  
    The [system entry group](/dataplex/docs/ingest-custom-sources#entry-groups) for data canvases is `  @dataform  ` . To view details of data canvas entries in Dataplex Universal Catalog, you need to view the `  dataform  ` system entry group. For instructions about how to view a list of all entries in an entry group, see [View details of an entry group](/dataplex/docs/ingest-custom-sources#entry-group-details) in the Dataplex Universal Catalog documentation.
  - System entry type  
    The [system entry type](/dataplex/docs/ingest-custom-sources#entry-types) for data canvases is `  dataform-code-asset  ` . To view details of data canvases, you need to view the `  dataform-code-asset  ` system entry type, filter the results with an aspect-based filter, and [set the `  type  ` field inside `  dataform-code-asset  ` aspect to `  DATA_CANVAS  `](/dataplex/docs/search-syntax#aspect-search) . Then, select an entry of the selected data canvas. For instructions about how to view details of a selected entry type, see [View details of an entry type](/dataplex/docs/ingest-custom-sources#entry-type-details) in the Dataplex Universal Catalog documentation. For instructions about how to view details of a selected entry, see [View details of an entry](/dataplex/docs/search-assets#view-entry-details) in the Dataplex Universal Catalog documentation.
  - System aspect type  
    The [system aspect type](/dataplex/docs/enrich-entries-metadata#aspect-types) for data canvases is `  dataform-code-asset  ` . To provide additional context to data canvases in Dataplex Universal Catalog by annotating data canvas entries with [aspects](/dataplex/docs/enrich-entries-metadata#aspects) , view the `  dataform-code-asset  ` aspect type, filter the results with an aspect-based filter, and [set the `  type  ` field inside `  dataform-code-asset  ` aspect to `  DATA_CANVAS  `](/dataplex/docs/search-syntax#aspect-search) . For instructions about how to annotate entries with aspects, see [Manage aspects and enrich metadata](/dataplex/docs/enrich-entries-metadata) in the Dataplex Universal Catalog documentation.
  - Type  
    The type for data canvases is `  DATA_CANVAS  ` . This type lets you filter data canvases in the `  dataform-code-asset  ` system entry type and the `  dataform-code-asset  ` aspect type by using the `  aspect:dataplex-types.global.dataform-code-asset.type=DATA_CANVAS  ` query in an [aspect-based filter](/dataplex/docs/search-syntax#aspect-search) .

For instructions about how to search for assets in Dataplex Universal Catalog, see [Search for data assets in Dataplex Universal Catalog](/dataplex/docs/search-assets) in the Dataplex Universal Catalog documentation.
