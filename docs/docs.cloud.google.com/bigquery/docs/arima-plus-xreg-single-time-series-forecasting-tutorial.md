This tutorial teaches you how to use a [multivariate time series model](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-multivariate-time-series) to forecast the future value for a given column, based on the historical value of multiple input features.

This tutorial forecasts a single time series. Forecasted values are calculated once for each time point in the input data.

This tutorial uses data from the [`  bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality  ` public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=epa_historical_air_quality&page=dataset) . This dataset contains information about daily particulate matter (PM2.5), temperature, and wind speed information collected from multiple US cities.

## Objectives

This tutorial guides you through completing the following tasks:

  - Creating a time series model to forecast PM2.5 values by using the [`  CREATE MODEL  ` statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-multivariate-time-series) .
  - Evaluating the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) information in the model by using the [`  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-arima-evaluate) .
  - Inspecting the model coefficients by using the [`  ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-arima-coefficients) .
  - Retrieving the forecasted PM2.5 values from the model by using the [`  ML.FORECAST  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-forecast) .
  - Evaluating the model's accuracy by using the [`  ML.EVALUATE  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-evaluate) .
  - Retrieving components of the time series, such as seasonality, trend, and feature attributions, by using the [`  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-explain-forecast) . You can inspect these time series components in order to explain the forecasted values.

## Before you begin

1.  BigQuery is automatically enabled in new projects. To activate BigQuery in a pre-existing project, go to
    
    Enable the BigQuery API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

## Required Permissions

  - To create the dataset, you need the `  bigquery.datasets.create  ` IAM permission.

  - To create the model, you need the following permissions:
    
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `
      - `  bigquery.models.create  `
      - `  bigquery.models.getData  `
      - `  bigquery.models.updateData  `

  - To run inference, you need the following permissions:
    
      - `  bigquery.models.getData  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

For more information about IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see [Introduction to IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

## Create a dataset

Create a BigQuery dataset to store your ML model.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, click your project name.

3.  Click more\_vert **View actions \> Create dataset**

4.  On the **Create dataset** page, do the following:
    
      - For **Dataset ID** , enter `  bqml_tutorial  ` .
    
      - For **Location type** , select **Multi-region** , and then select **US (multiple regions in United States)** .
    
      - Leave the remaining default settings as they are, and click **Create dataset** .

### bq

To create a new dataset, use the [`  bq mk  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#mk-dataset) command with the `  --location  ` flag. For a full list of possible parameters, see the [`  bq mk --dataset  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#mk-dataset) reference.

1.  Create a dataset named `  bqml_tutorial  ` with the data location set to `  US  ` and a description of `  BigQuery ML tutorial dataset  ` :
    
    ``` text
    bq --location=US mk -d \
     --description "BigQuery ML tutorial dataset." \
     bqml_tutorial
    ```
    
    Instead of using the `  --dataset  ` flag, the command uses the `  -d  ` shortcut. If you omit `  -d  ` and `  --dataset  ` , the command defaults to creating a dataset.

2.  Confirm that the dataset was created:
    
    ``` text
    bq ls
    ```

### API

Call the [`  datasets.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/datasets/insert) method with a defined [dataset resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/datasets) .

``` text
{
  "datasetReference": {
     "datasetId": "bqml_tutorial"
  }
}
```

### BigQuery DataFrames

Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using BigQuery DataFrames](/bigquery/docs/dataframes-quickstart) . For more information, see the [BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) .

``` python
import google.cloud.bigquery

bqclient = google.cloud.bigquery.Client()
bqclient.create_dataset("bqml_tutorial", exists_ok=True)
```

## Create a table of input data

Create a table of data that you can use to train and evaluate the model. This table combines columns from several tables in the `  bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality  ` dataset in order to provide daily data weather data. You also create the following columns to use as input variables for the model:

  - `  date  ` : the date of the observation
  - `  pm25  ` the average PM2.5 value for each day
  - `  wind_speed  ` : the average wind speed for each day
  - `  temperature  ` : the highest temperature for each day

In the following GoogleSQL query, the `  FROM bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.*_daily_summary  ` clause indicates that you are querying the `  *_daily_summary  ` tables in the `  epa_historical_air_quality  ` dataset. These tables are [partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) .

Follow these steps to create the input data table:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** :
    
    ``` text
    CREATE TABLE `bqml_tutorial.seattle_air_quality_daily`
    AS
    WITH
      pm25_daily AS (
        SELECT
          avg(arithmetic_mean) AS pm25, date_local AS date
        FROM
          `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.pm25_nonfrm_daily_summary`
        WHERE
          city_name = 'Seattle'
          AND parameter_name = 'Acceptable PM2.5 AQI & Speciation Mass'
        GROUP BY date_local
      ),
      wind_speed_daily AS (
        SELECT
          avg(arithmetic_mean) AS wind_speed, date_local AS date
        FROM
          `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.wind_daily_summary`
        WHERE
          city_name = 'Seattle' AND parameter_name = 'Wind Speed - Resultant'
        GROUP BY date_local
      ),
      temperature_daily AS (
        SELECT
          avg(first_max_value) AS temperature, date_local AS date
        FROM
          `bigquery-public-data.epa_historical_air_quality.temperature_daily_summary`
        WHERE
          city_name = 'Seattle' AND parameter_name = 'Outdoor Temperature'
        GROUP BY date_local
      )
    SELECT
      pm25_daily.date AS date, pm25, wind_speed, temperature
    FROM pm25_daily
    JOIN wind_speed_daily USING (date)
    JOIN temperature_daily USING (date);
    ```

## Visualize the input data

Before creating the model, you can optionally visualize your input time series data to get a sense of the distribution. You can do this by using Looker Studio.

Follow these steps to visualize the time series data:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      `bqml_tutorial.seattle_air_quality_daily`;
    ```

3.  When the query completes, click **Open in** \> **Looker Studio** . Looker Studio opens in a new tab. Complete the following steps in the new tab.

4.  In the Looker Studio, click **Insert** \> **Time series chart** .

5.  In the **Chart** pane, choose the **Setup** tab.

6.  In the **Metric** section, add the **pm25** , **temperature** , and **wind\_speed** fields, and remove the default **Record Count** metric. The resulting chart looks similar to the following:
    
    Looking at the chart, you can see that the input time series has a weekly seasonal pattern.

**Note:** For more information about Looker Studio support, see [Looker Support integrations with Google Cloud](/looker/docs/best-practices/looker-support-integrations-with-google-cloud) .

## Create the time series model

Create a time series model to forecast particulate matter values, as represented by the `  pm25  ` column, using the `  pm25  ` , `  wind_speed  ` , and `  temperature  ` column values as input variables. Train the model on the air quality data from the `  bqml_tutorial.seattle_air_quality_daily  ` table, selecting the data gathered between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2020.

In the following query, the `  OPTIONS(model_type='ARIMA_PLUS_XREG', time_series_timestamp_col='date', ...)  ` clause indicates that you are creating an ARIMA with external regressors model. The [`  auto_arima  ` option](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-multivariate-time-series#auto_arima) of the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement defaults to `  TRUE  ` , so the `  auto.ARIMA  ` algorithm automatically tunes the hyperparameters in the model. The algorithm fits dozens of candidate models and chooses the best model, which is the model with the lowest [Akaike information criterion (AIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion) . The [`  data_frequency  ` option](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-multivariate-time-series#data_frequency) of the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statements defaults to `  AUTO_FREQUENCY  ` , so the training process automatically infers the data frequency of the input time series.

Follow these steps to create the model:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** :
    
    ``` text
    CREATE OR REPLACE
      MODEL
        `bqml_tutorial.seattle_pm25_xreg_model`
      OPTIONS (
        MODEL_TYPE = 'ARIMA_PLUS_XREG',
        time_series_timestamp_col = 'date',  # Identifies the column that contains time points
        time_series_data_col = 'pm25')       # Identifies the column to forecast
    AS
    SELECT
      date,                                  # The column that contains time points
      pm25,                                  # The column to forecast
      temperature,                           # Temperature input to use in forecasting
      wind_speed                             # Wind speed input to use in forecasting
    FROM
      `bqml_tutorial.seattle_air_quality_daily`
    WHERE
      date
      BETWEEN DATE('2012-01-01')
      AND DATE('2020-12-31');
    ```
    
    The query takes about 20 seconds to complete, after which you can access the `  seattle_pm25_xreg_model  ` model. Because the query uses a `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement to create a model, you don't see query results.

**Note:** You might wonder if United States holidays have an impact on the time series. You can try setting the [`  holiday_region  ` option](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-multivariate-time-series#holiday_region) of the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement to `  US  ` . Setting this option allows a more accurate modeling on holiday time points if there are any holiday patterns in the time series.

## Evaluate the candidate models

Evaluate the time series models by using the `  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE  ` function. The `  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE  ` function shows you the evaluation metrics of all the candidate models that were evaluated during the process of automatic hyperparameter tuning.

Follow these steps to evaluate the model:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
     *
    FROM
     ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.seattle_pm25_xreg_model`);
    ```
    
    The results should look similar to the following:
    
    The `  non_seasonal_p  ` , `  non_seasonal_d  ` , `  non_seasonal_q  ` , and `  has_drift  ` output columns define an ARIMA model in the training pipeline. The `  log_likelihood  ` , `  AIC  ` , and `  variance  ` output columns are relevant to the ARIMA model fitting process.
    
    The `  auto.ARIMA  ` algorithm uses the [KPSS test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPSS_test) to determine the best value for `  non_seasonal_d  ` , which in this case is `  1  ` . When `  non_seasonal_d  ` is `  1  ` , the `  auto.ARIMA  ` algorithm trains 42 different candidate ARIMA models in parallel. In this example, all 42 candidate models are valid, so the output contains 42 rows, one for each candidate ARIMA model; in cases where some of the models aren't valid, they are excluded from the output. These candidate models are returned in ascending order by AIC. The model in the first row has the lowest AIC, and is considered the best model. The best model is saved as the final model and is used when you call functions such as `  ML.FORECAST  ` on the model.
    
    The `  seasonal_periods  ` column contains information about the seasonal pattern identified in the time series data. It has nothing to do with the ARIMA modeling, therefore it has the same value across all output rows. It reports a weekly pattern, which agrees with the results you saw if you chose to visualize the input data.
    
    The `  has_holiday_effect  ` , `  has_spikes_and_dips  ` , and `  has_step_changes  ` columns provide information about the input time series data, and are not related to the ARIMA modeling. These columns are returned because the value of the `  decompose_time_series  ` option in the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement is `  TRUE  ` . These columns also have the same values across all output rows.
    
    The `  error_message  ` column shows any errors that incurred during the `  auto.ARIMA  ` fitting process. One possible reason for errors is when the selected `  non_seasonal_p  ` , `  non_seasonal_d  ` , `  non_seasonal_q  ` , and `  has_drift  ` columns are not able to stabilize the time series. To retrieve the error message of all the candidate models, set the `  show_all_candidate_models  ` option to `  TRUE  ` when you create the model.
    
    For more information about the output columns, see [`  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-arima-evaluate) .

## Inspect the model's coefficients

Inspect the time series model's coefficients by using the `  ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS  ` function.

Follow these steps to retrieve the model's coefficients:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
     *
    FROM
     ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.seattle_pm25_xreg_model`);
    ```
    
    The results should look similar to the following:
    
    The `  ar_coefficients  ` output column shows the model coefficients of the autoregressive (AR) part of the ARIMA model. Similarly, the `  ma_coefficients  ` output column shows the model coefficients of the moving-average (MA) part of the ARIMA model. Both of these columns contain array values, whose lengths are equal to `  non_seasonal_p  ` and `  non_seasonal_q  ` , respectively. You saw in the output of the `  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE  ` function that the best model has a `  non_seasonal_p  ` value of `  0  ` and a `  non_seasonal_q  ` value of `  5  ` . Therefore, in the `  ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS  ` output, the `  ar_coefficients  ` value is an empty array and the `  ma_coefficients  ` value is a 5-element array. The `  intercept_or_drift  ` value is the constant term in the ARIMA model.
    
    The `  processed_input  ` , `  weight  ` , and `  category_weights  ` output column show the weights for each feature and the intercept in the linear regression model. If the feature is a numerical feature, the weight is in the `  weight  ` column. If the feature is a categorical feature, the `  category_weights  ` value is an array of struct values, where each struct value contains the name and weight of a given category.
    
    For more information about the output columns, see [`  ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-arima-coefficients) .

## Use the model to forecast data

Forecast future time series values by using the `  ML.FORECAST  ` function.

In the following GoogleSQL query, the `  STRUCT(30 AS horizon, 0.8 AS confidence_level)  ` clause indicates that the query forecasts 30 future time points, and generates a prediction interval with a 80% confidence level.

Follow these steps to forecast data with the model:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      ML.FORECAST(
        MODEL `bqml_tutorial.seattle_pm25_xreg_model`,
        STRUCT(30 AS horizon, 0.8 AS confidence_level),
        (
          SELECT
            date,
            temperature,
            wind_speed
          FROM
            `bqml_tutorial.seattle_air_quality_daily`
          WHERE
            date > DATE('2020-12-31')
        ));
    ```
    
    The results should look similar to the following:
    
    The output rows are in chronological order by the `  forecast_timestamp  ` column value. In time series forecasting, the prediction interval, as represented by the `  prediction_interval_lower_bound  ` and `  prediction_interval_upper_bound  ` column values, is as important as the `  forecast_value  ` column value. The `  forecast_value  ` value is the middle point of the prediction interval. The prediction interval depends on the `  standard_error  ` and `  confidence_level  ` column values.
    
    For more information about the output columns, see [`  ML.FORECAST  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-forecast) .

## Evaluate forecasting accuracy

Evaluate the forecasting accuracy of the model by using the `  ML.EVALUATE  ` function.

In the following GoogleSQL query, the second `  SELECT  ` statement provides the data with the future features, which are used to forecast the future values to compare to the actual data.

Follow these steps to evaluate the model's accuracy:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      ML.EVALUATE(
        MODEL `bqml_tutorial.seattle_pm25_xreg_model`,
        (
          SELECT
            date,
            pm25,
            temperature,
            wind_speed
          FROM
            `bqml_tutorial.seattle_air_quality_daily`
          WHERE
            date > DATE('2020-12-31')
        ),
        STRUCT(
          TRUE AS perform_aggregation,
          30 AS horizon));
    ```
    
    The results should look similar to the following:
    
    For more information about the output columns, see [`  ML.EVALUATE  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-evaluate) .

## Explain the forecasting results

You can get explainability metrics in addition to forecast data by using the `  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function. The `  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function forecasts future time series values and also returns all the separate components of the time series.

Similar to the `  ML.FORECAST  ` function, the `  STRUCT(30 AS horizon, 0.8 AS confidence_level)  ` clause used in the `  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function indicates that the query forecasts 30 future time points and generates a prediction interval with 80% confidence.

Follow these steps to explain the model's results:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST(
        MODEL `bqml_tutorial.seattle_pm25_xreg_model`,
        STRUCT(30 AS horizon, 0.8 AS confidence_level),
        (
          SELECT
            date,
            temperature,
            wind_speed
          FROM
            `bqml_tutorial.seattle_air_quality_daily`
          WHERE
            date > DATE('2020-12-31')
        ));
    ```
    
    The results should look similar to the following:
    
    The output rows are ordered chronologically by the `  time_series_timestamp  ` column value.
    
    For more information about the output columns, see [`  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-explain-forecast) .
