# Optimize load jobs

The strategies and best practices described in this document help you optimize batch loading or streaming data into BigQuery to avoid reaching [the limit for the number of load jobs](/bigquery/quotas#load_jobs) per table, per day.

Because the limit for load jobs is fixed and can't be increased, you should optimize your load jobs by structuring your tables through methods such as table partitions, or by managing your loads through methods such as batch loading or streaming.

## How table operations quotas work

The BigQuery limit for table modifications per table per day per project is fixed, regardless of whether modifications append or update data, or truncate the table. This limit includes the combined total of all [load jobs](/bigquery/quotas#load_jobs) , [copy jobs](/bigquery/quotas#copy_jobs) , and [query jobs](/bigquery/quotas#query_jobs) that add to or overwrite a destination table.

Load jobs have a *refill rate* . If you exceed the table operation limit or its refill rate, load jobs fail with a `  quotaExceeded  ` error. The project-level limit for load jobs per day refills within a rolling 24-hour period. When load jobs finish, your available quota decreases. The quota then gradually refills over the next 24 hours. Failed load jobs still count toward both per-table and per-project quotas. For more information about load job limits, see [Load jobs](/bigquery/quotas#load_jobs) .

For partitioned tables, a separate [limit for partitioned table modifications](/bigquery/quotas#partitioned_tables) applies, replacing the standard table limit.

To stay within your daily table operation limits, spread operations over a 24-hour period. For example, if you perform 25 updates, each with 60 operations, you can run about 60 operations every 58 minutes. This approach helps you meet the daily limit. To monitor table updates, see [BigQuery `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` views](/bigquery/docs/monitoring#information-schema) .

### Table operations excluded from quota

Updating table information (metadata) and using DML statements does not count toward your daily table modification limit. This exclusion applies to both standard and partitioned tables.

Your project can run an unlimited number of DML statements. While DML statements previously counted toward daily table modifications and were not throttled even at the limit, they no longer do.

*Streaming inserts* also modify tables, but [their own specific quotas](/bigquery/quotas#streaming_inserts) govern them.

## Load strategies to avoid the table operations limit

To stay within BigQuery's daily table operation limit, consider these best practices:

  - Perform fewer, larger writes instead of many small ones.
  - Minimize separate write jobs to your final production table each day.

To use these best practices, batch or stream your data into BigQuery. Your choice of load method depends on whether you need to load high volumes of data in real time, or if real-time loading is not a concern. The following sections explain batch loading and data streaming in detail, including the tools and services you can use for each method.

## Batch loading

To stay within the daily load limit per project for BigQuery, batch large amounts of data and load it with fewer jobs into BigQuery. The following sections describe several methods you can use to batch load your data.

### Load more data for each job

Instead of sending data to BigQuery each time new information becomes available, collect and load it into BigQuery using a single large job.

For example, instead of running a separate load job for every few rows of data, you can wait until you accumulate several thousand rows of data in a file—for example, in a CSV or JSON file—and then run one load job to append all the data to a table. This action counts as one table operation, even though the job contains much more data. You can batch your files by [using wildcards](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#load-wildcards) with your load job. Wildcards let you select batches of files in a directory to load multiple files in a single load job.

The following example shows how to use wildcards with your `  bq load  ` command or SQL `  LOAD DATA  ` queries.

### bq

The following example shows a [`  bq load  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_load) to load CSV data from Cloud Storage into a BigQuery table named `  my_target_table  ` . To select more than one source filename, use a wildcard with the command. The `  AUTODETECT  ` flag automatically determines your table schema from the source data in Cloud Storage, and can support a wildcard ( `  *  ` ) to load multiple files that fit a specific naming pattern into the BigQuery table.

``` text
bq load \
  --source_format=CSV \
  --autodetect \
  --project_id=PROJECT_ID \
  DATASET_NAME.TABLE_NAME \
  "gs://BUCKET_NAME/OBJECT_PATH_WILDCARD"
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the ID of your Google Cloud project.
  - `  DATASET_NAME  ` : the name of the BigQuery dataset where you want to load the data.
  - `  TABLE_NAME  ` : the name of the BigQuery table where you want to load the data.
  - `  BUCKET_NAME  ` : the name of your Cloud Storage bucket that contains the source files.
  - `  OBJECT_PATH_WILDCARD  ` : the path to your CSV files in the Cloud Storage bucket. Include a wildcard ( `  *  ` ) to match multiple files. For example, the string `  gs://my-bucket/path/to/data/my_prefix_*.csv  ` uses the wildcard character `  *  ` to load all files in `  gs://my-bucket/path/to/data/  ` that begin with `  my_prefix_  ` and end with `  .csv  ` .

For more information, see the following:

  - [Wildcard support for Cloud Storage URIs](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#load-wildcards)
  - [bq command-line tool reference](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference)

### SQL

The following example shows how to use the SQL [`  LOAD DATA  ` query](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/load-statements) to load CSV data from a Cloud Storage bucket into BigQuery table. To select more than one source filename, use a wildcard with the command.

``` text
LOAD DATA INTO
DATASET_NAME.TABLE_NAME
FROM FILES (
  format = 'SOURCE_FORMAT',
  uris = ['gs://BUCKET_NAME/OBJECT_PATH_WILDCARD]
  );
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DATASET_NAME  ` : the name of the BigQuery dataset where you want to load the data.
  - `  TABLE_NAME  ` : the name of the BigQuery table where you want to load the data.
  - The `  SOURCE_FORMAT  ` sets the type of your source files, for example, `  CSV  ` or `  JSON  ` . In this example, use `  CSV  ` .
  - `  BUCKET_NAME  ` : the name of your Cloud Storage bucket that contains the source files.
  - `  OBJECT_PATH_WILDCARD  ` : the path to your CSV files in the Cloud Storage bucket. Include a wildcard ( `  *  ` ) to match multiple files. For example, the string `  gs://my-bucket/path/to/data/my_prefix_*.csv  ` uses the wildcard character `  *  ` to load all files in `  gs://my-bucket/path/to/data/  ` that begin with `  my_prefix_  ` and end with `  .csv  ` .

For more information, see [Load statements in GoogleSQL](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/load-statements) .

### Batch load using the BigQuery Storage Write API

To load batch data into BigQuery, one option is to use the Storage Write API directly from your application with the Google API Client Libraries.

The Storage Write API optimizes data loading to stay within table limits. For high-volume, real-time streaming, use a `  PENDING  ` stream, rather than a `  COMMITTED  ` stream. When you use a `  PENDING  ` stream, the API temporarily stores records until you commit the stream.

For a complete example of batch loading data using the Storage Write API, see [Batch load data using the Storage Write API](/bigquery/docs/write-api-batch-load) .

### Batch load using Dataflow

If you want to stream, transform, and write data into BigQuery using data pipelines, you can use Dataflow. The data pipelines that you create read from supported sources like Pub/Sub or Apache Kafka. You can also create a Dataflow pipeline using the `  BigQueryIO  ` connector, which uses the Storage Write API for high-performance data streaming and exactly-once semantics.

For information about using Dataflow to batch load data to BigQuery, see [Write from Dataflow to BigQuery](/dataflow/docs/guides/write-to-bigquery) .

## Data streaming

To load high volumes of data with frequent updates, we recommend that you stream your data into BigQuery. With data streaming, new data continuously writes from your client application into BigQuery, a strategy that avoids reaching the limit for running too many load jobs. The following sections describe several methods to stream your data into BigQuery.

### Stream data using the Storage Write API

Use the [Storage Write API](/bigquery/docs/write-api) to stream records in real time into BigQuery with minimal latency. The [Storage Write API](/bigquery/docs/write-api) provides an efficient streaming protocol that provides advanced functionality like exactly-once delivery semantics, schema update detection, and streaming Change Data Capture (CDC) upserts. In addition, you can ingest up to 2 TiB per month at no cost.

For information about using the Storage Write API, see [Streaming data using the Storage Write API](/bigquery/docs/write-api-streaming) .

### Stream data using Dataflow

Use Dataflow to create data pipelines that read from supported sources, for example, Pub/Sub or Apache Kafka. These pipelines then transform and write the data to BigQuery as a destination. You can create a Dataflow pipeline using the `  BigQueryIO  ` connector, which uses the Storage Write API.

For information about using Dataflow to stream data to BigQuery, see [Write from Dataflow to BigQuery](/dataflow/docs/guides/write-to-bigquery) .

## Best practices to manage your tables for loading

In addition to batch loading or streaming data into BigQuery, manage your tables in the following ways to optimize them for data ingestion.

### Use partitioned tables

[Table partitioning](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) is a powerful technique for managing large tables in BigQuery, especially when you need to perform frequent data loading operations. You can significantly improve table performance and cost-effectiveness by dividing a table into smaller, more manageable segments based on a date, timestamp, or integer.

The primary advantage of partitioning for data loading is that the daily table operation quotas for BigQuery apply at the partition level rather than at the table level. For partitioned tables, a separate, higher limit applies to [partition modifications](/bigquery/quotas#partitioned_tables) , which replaces the [standard table limit](/bigquery/quotas#standard_tables) . The limit for partitioned tables dramatically increases the number of load jobs you can run per day without reaching quota limits.

A common and highly effective strategy is to batch load your daily data. For example, you can gather all of the day's data for `  2025-09-18  ` in a temporary staging table. Then, at the end of the day, you run a single job to load this data into the specific partition for this day in your main production table. Because BigQuery interacts only with the data for a single partition, this approach keeps your data well organized and makes your loading operations faster and less expensive.

While partitioning is highly recommended for large, growing tables, it's best to avoid it if your partitions would be consistently smaller than 10 GB. For more information, see [When to use partitioning](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables#when_to_use_partitioning) .

To learn more about the different partitioning methods available, such as time-unit and integer-range partitioning, see [Types of partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables#types_of_partitioning) .

### Take advantage of built-in exponential backoff, truncate, and jitter

Built-in [exponential backoff and retry](/bigquery/docs/reliability-intro#error_handling) is an error-handling method that helps your application recover smoothly when an operation fails temporarily. Such failures can include a rate limit error ( `  rateLimitExceeded  ` ) or a brief network problem ( `  unavailable  ` ).

In a reliable system, workers that take tasks from your client-side queue also use exponential backoff and retry. They do this when calling BigQuery, which creates two levels of protection.

For example, the official `  google-cloud-bigquery-storage  ` library for Python includes built-in retry logic with exponential backoff. This logic handles temporary gRPC errors, for example, `  UNAVAILABLE  ` . In most cases, you don't need to write this retry code yourself. The `  client.append_rows()  ` call handles these retries automatically.

This built-in handling is a significant benefit of using the official client libraries. You only need to deal with errors that cannot be retried, for example, `  INVALID_ARGUMENT  ` , which means there is a schema mismatch.
