# Analyze data with BI Engine and Looker

Looker is an enterprise platform for business intelligence, data applications, and embedded analytics. Looker helps you explore, share, and visualize your company's data so that you can make better business decisions.

## How Looker works

Looker lets data experts at each organization describe their data using a lightweight modeling language called LookML. LookML tells Looker how to query data, so everyone in the organization can create easy-to-read reports and dashboards to explore patterns of data. Looker offers additional features for creating custom data applications and experiences.

Looker's platform works with transactional databases like Oracle and MySQL as well as analytical datastores like BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, and more. Looker lets you create consistent data models on top of all your data with speed and accuracy. Looker offers a unified surface to access all of an organization's data.

## Looker integration with BigQuery

Looker supports hosting in Google Cloud. Because Looker is platform independent, it connects to data in BigQuery as well as other public clouds.

You don't need Looker to use BigQuery. However, if your BigQuery use case includes business intelligence, data applications, or embedded analytics you might want to review Looker as a provider of these services.

If you already have a Looker instance running, see the [instructions for connecting Looker to BigQuery](/looker/docs/db-config-google-bigquery) .

## Get started with Looker and BigQuery

The BI Engine seamlessly integrates with any business intelligence (BI) tools, including Looker. For more information, see [BI Engine overview](/bigquery/docs/bi-engine-intro) .

## Create a BigQuery dataset

The first step is to create a BigQuery dataset to store your BI Engine-managed table. To create your dataset, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, click your project.

4.  In the details pane, click more\_vert **View actions** , and then click **Create dataset** .

5.  On the **Create dataset** page, do the following:
    
      - For **Dataset ID** , enter `  biengine_tutorial  ` .
    
      - For **Data location** , choose **us (multiple regions in United States)** , the [multi-region location](/bigquery/docs/locations#multi-regions) where public datasets are stored.
    
      - For this tutorial, you can select **Enable table expiration** , and then specify the number of days before the table expires.

6.  Leave all of the other default settings in place and click **Create dataset** .

## Create a table by copying data from a public dataset

This tutorial uses a dataset available through the [Google Cloud Public Dataset Program](/bigquery/public-data) . Public datasets are datasets that BigQuery hosts for you to access and integrate into your applications.

In this section, you create a table by copying data from the [San Francisco 311 service requests](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/san-francisco-public-data/sf-311?filter=solution-type:dataset) dataset. You can explore the dataset by using the [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=san_francisco_311&page=dataset) .

### Create your table

To create your table, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, search for the `  san_francisco_311  ` dataset.

4.  Click the dataset, and then click **Overview \> Tables** .

5.  Click the `  311_service_requests  ` table.

6.  In the toolbar, click **Copy** .

7.  In the **Copy table** dialog, in the **Destination** section, do the following:
    
      - For **Project** , click **Browse** , and then select your project.
    
      - For **Dataset** , select **biengine\_tutorial** .
    
      - For **Table** , enter `  311_service_requests_copy  ` .

8.  Click **Copy** .

9.  Optional: After the copy job is complete, verify the table contents by expanding **`  PROJECT_NAME  ` \> biengine\_tutorial** and clicking **311\_service\_requests\_copy \> Preview** . Replace **`  PROJECT_NAME  `** with name of your Google Cloud project for this tutorial.

## Create your BI Engine reservation

1.  In the Google Cloud console, under **Administration** go to the **BI Engine** page.
    
    **Note:** If prompted to enable **BigQuery Reservation API** , click **Enable** .

2.  Click add **Create reservation** .

3.  On the **Create Reservation** page, configure your BI Engine reservation:
    
      - In the **Project** list, verify your Google Cloud project.
    
      - In the **Location** list, select a location. The location should match the [location of the datasets](/bigquery/docs/locations) that you're querying.
    
      - Adjust the **GiB of Capacity** slider to the amount of memory capacity that you're reserving. The following example sets the capacity to 2 GiB. The maximum is 250 GiB.

4.  Click **Next** .

5.  In the **Preferred Tables** section, optionally specify tables for acceleration with BI Engine. To find table names, do the following:
    
    1.  In the **Table Id** field, type part of the name of the table that you want accelerated by BI Engine—for example, `  311  ` .
    
    2.  From the list of suggested names, select your table names.
        
        Only specified tables are eligible for acceleration. If no preferred tables are specified, all project queries are eligible for acceleration.

6.  Click **Next** .

7.  In the **Confirm and submit** section, review the agreement.

8.  If you accept the terms of agreement, click **Create** .

After you confirm your reservation, the details are displayed on the **Reservations** page.

## Connect using Looker

**Shortcut:** If you already have a Looker model using a BigQuery dataset with a service account, in a project that is BI Engine-enabled, then no additional configuration is required.

The following instructions show you how to set up Looker with BigQuery.

1.  Log in to Looker as an administrator.

2.  In the Looker documentation about BigQuery, complete the following sections:
    
    1.  [Creating a service account](/looker/docs/db-config-google-bigquery#creating_a_service_account_and_downloading_the_json_credentials_certificate) .
    2.  [Configure an OAuth for a BigQuery connection in Looker](/looker/docs/db-config-google-bigquery#configuring_oauth_for_a_bigquery_connection) .
    
    **Note:** Ensure that the service account you create uses the same billing project as the project for which you enabled a BI Engine reservation.

3.  Click the **Develop** tab and select **Development Mode** .

4.  Generate a LookML model and project for your dataset. For more information, see the [instructions for connecting Looker to your database](/looker/docs/connecting-to-your-db) .

5.  Using the **Explore** menu, navigate to an explore associate with the new model file name **Explore 311\_service\_requests\_copy** (or whatever you named your explore).

You have successfully connected Looker to BigQuery. You can use the System Activity feature in Looker to generate a Looker usage report and analyze the performance of your queries against BigQuery-specific performance metrics. To explore various BigQuery BI Engine query performance metrics, see [BigQuery BI Engine metrics](/looker/docs/query-performance-metrics#bigquery_bi_engine_metrics) .

## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this quickstart, you can delete the project, delete the BI Engine reservation, or both.

### Delete the project

The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you created for the tutorial.

To delete the project:

**Caution:** Caution: Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for this tutorial, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an **appspot.com** URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project. If you plan to explore multiple tutorials and quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

<!-- end list -->

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

2.  In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

3.  In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete' the project.

### Delete the reservation

Alternatively, if you intend to keep the project, then you can avoid additional BI Engine costs by deleting your capacity reservation.

To delete your reservation, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, under **Administration** go to the **BI Engine** page.
    
    **Note:** If prompted to enable **BigQuery Reservation API** , click **Enable** .

2.  In the **Reservations** section, locate your reservation.

3.  In the **Actions** column, click the more\_vert icon to the right of your reservation and choose **Delete** .

4.  In the **Delete reservation?** dialog, enter **Delete** and then click **DELETE** .
