This tutorial introduces you to geospatial analytics. Geospatial analytics let you easily analyze and visualize geospatial data in BigQuery.

## Objectives

In this tutorial, you:

  - Use a geospatial analytics function to convert latitude and longitude columns into geographical points
  - Run a query that plots the path of a hurricane
  - Visualize your results in BigQuery
  - Visualize your results in [BigQuery Geo Viz](/bigquery/docs/geospatial-visualize)

## Costs

BigQuery is a paid product and you will incur BigQuery usage in this tutorial. BigQuery offers some resources free of charge up to a specific limit. For more information, see [BigQuery free operations and free tier](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#free) .

## Before you begin

Before you begin this tutorial, use the Google Cloud console to create or select a project.

1.  BigQuery is automatically enabled in new projects. To activate BigQuery in an existing project, go to
    
    Enable the BigQuery API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

2.  Optional: [Enable billing](/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) for the project. If you don't want to enable billing or provide a credit card, the steps in this document still work. BigQuery provides you a sandbox to perform the steps. For more information, see [Enable the BigQuery sandbox](/bigquery/docs/sandbox#setup) .
    
    **Note:** If your project has a billing account and you want to use the BigQuery sandbox, then [disable billing for your project](/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#disable_billing_for_a_project) .

## Explore the sample data

This tutorial uses a dataset available through the [Google Cloud Public Dataset Program](https://cloud.google.com/datasets) . A public dataset is any dataset that is stored in BigQuery and made available to the general public. The public datasets are datasets that BigQuery hosts for you to access and integrate into your applications. Google pays for the storage of these datasets and provides public access to the data by using a [project](/bigquery/docs/projects) . You pay only for the queries that you perform on the data (the first 1 TB per month is free, subject to [query pricing details](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#analysis_pricing_models) ).

### The Global Hurricane Tracks (IBTrACS) dataset

[Global Hurricane Tracks (IBTrACS) dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=noaa_hurricanes&page=dataset)

The historical positions and intensities along the tracks of global tropical cyclones (TC) are provided by NOAA's International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS). Tropical cyclones are known as hurricanes in the north Atlantic and northeast Pacific ocean basins, typhoons in the northwest Pacific ocean basin, cyclones in the north and south Indian Ocean basins, and tropical cyclones in the southwest Pacific ocean basin.

IBTrACS collects data about TCs reported by international monitoring centers who have a responsibility to forecast and report on TCs (and also includes some important historical datasets). IBTrACS includes data from 9 different countries. Historically, the data describing these systems has included best estimates of their track and intensity (hence the term, best track).

You can start exploring this data in the Google Cloud console by viewing the details of the `  hurricanes  ` table:

## Query the path of hurricane Maria in 2017

In this section of the tutorial, you run a GoogleSQL query that finds the path of hurricane Maria in the 2017 season. To plot the hurricane's path, you query the hurricane's location at different points in time.

### Query details

The following GoogleSQL query is used to find the path of hurricane Maria.

``` text
SELECT
  ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude) AS point,
  name,
  iso_time,
  dist2land,
  usa_wind,
  usa_pressure,
  usa_sshs,
  (usa_r34_ne + usa_r34_nw + usa_r34_se + usa_r34_sw)/4 AS radius_34kt,
  (usa_r50_ne + usa_r50_nw + usa_r50_se + usa_r50_sw)/4 AS radius_50kt
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
WHERE
  name LIKE '%MARIA%'
  AND season = '2017'
  AND ST_DWithin(ST_GeogFromText('POLYGON((-179 26, -179 48, -10 48, -10 26, -100 -10.1, -179 26))'),
    ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude), 10)
ORDER BY
  iso_time ASC
```

The query clauses do the following:

  -   - `  SELECT ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude) AS point, name, iso_time, dist2land, usa_wind, usa_pressure, usa_sshs, (usa_r34_ne + usa_r34_nw + usa_r34_se + usa_r34_sw)/4 AS radius_34kt, (usa_r50_ne + usa_r50_nw + usa_r50_se + usa_r50_sw)/4 AS radius_50kt  `  
        The `  SELECT  ` clause selects all the storm's weather data and uses the `  ST_GeogPoint  ` function to convert the values in the `  latitude  ` and `  longitude  ` columns to `  GEOGRAPHY  ` types (points).

  -   - `  FROM bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes  `  
        The `  FROM  ` clause specifies the table being queried: `  hurricanes  ` .

  -   - `  WHERE name LIKE '%MARIA%' AND season = '2017' AND ST_DWithin(ST_GeogFromText('POLYGON((-179 26, -179 48, -10 48, -10 26, -100 -10.1, -179 26))'), ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude), 10)  `  
        The `  WHERE  ` clause filters the data to just the points in the Atlantic corresponding to hurricane Maria in the 2017 hurricane season.

  -   - `  ORDER BY iso_time ASC  `  
        The `  ORDER BY  ` clause orders the points to form a chronological storm path.

### Run the query

To run the query by using the Google Cloud console:

1.  Go to the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  Enter the following GoogleSQL query in the **Query editor** text area.
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude) AS point,
      name,
      iso_time,
      dist2land,
      usa_wind,
      usa_pressure,
      usa_sshs,
      (usa_r34_ne + usa_r34_nw + usa_r34_se + usa_r34_sw)/4 AS radius_34kt,
      (usa_r50_ne + usa_r50_nw + usa_r50_se + usa_r50_sw)/4 AS radius_50kt
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
    WHERE
      name LIKE '%MARIA%'
      AND season = '2017'
      AND ST_DWithin(ST_GeogFromText('POLYGON((-179 26, -179 48, -10 48, -10 26, -100 -10.1, -179 26))'),
        ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude), 10)
    ORDER BY
      iso_time ASC
    ```

3.  Click **Run** .
    
    The query takes a moment to complete. After the query runs, your results appear in the **Query results** pane.

## Visualize the query results in BigQuery

To visualize your results in BigQuery, follow these steps:

1.  To visualize your results in BigQuery, in the **Query results** pane, click **Visualization** .

2.  For **Data column** , select `  usa_wind  ` .
    
    A map appears with points for the hurricane's location over time, styled by a color gradient for wind speed.

3.  Optional: To adjust the visibility of the points, set **Min** to 0 and select a different color gradient from the **Color** list.

## Visualize the query results in Geo Viz

You can also visualize your results using BigQuery Geo Viz — A web tool for visualization of geospatial data in BigQuery using Google Maps APIs.

2.  In the query window, enter the following GoogleSQL query.
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude) AS point,
      name,
      iso_time,
      dist2land,
      usa_wind,
      usa_pressure,
      usa_sshs,
      (usa_r34_ne + usa_r34_nw + usa_r34_se + usa_r34_sw)/4 AS radius_34kt,
      (usa_r50_ne + usa_r50_nw + usa_r50_se + usa_r50_sw)/4 AS radius_50kt
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.noaa_hurricanes.hurricanes`
    WHERE
      name LIKE '%MARIA%'
      AND season = '2017'
      AND ST_DWithin(ST_GeogFromText('POLYGON((-179 26, -179 48, -10 48, -10 26, -100 -10.1, -179 26))'),
        ST_GeogPoint(longitude, latitude), 10)
    ORDER BY
      iso_time ASC
    ```

3.  Click **Run** .

4.  When the query completes, click **Show results** . You can also click step two **Data** .

5.  This moves you to step two. In step two, for **Geometry column** , choose **point** . This plots the points corresponding to hurricane Maria's path.

### Format your visualization in Geo Viz

The **Style** section provides a list of visual styles for customization. For more information about style properties and values, see [Format your visualization](/bigquery/docs/geospatial-get-started#format_your_visualization) .

To format your map:

    4.  For **Domain** , enter **`  0  `** in the first box and **`  135  `** in the second.
    
    5.  For **Range** , enter **`  5  `** in the first box and **`  135000  `** in the second.

10. Examine your map. The radius of each point now corresponds to the radius of the hurricane.

11. Close Geo Viz.

## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and delete the individual resources.

  - You can delete the project you created.
  - Or you can keep the project for future use.

To delete the project:

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `  appspot.com  ` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
