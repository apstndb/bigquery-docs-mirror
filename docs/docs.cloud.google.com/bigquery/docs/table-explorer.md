This document shows you how to use table explorer to examine table data and create data exploration queries.

## About table explorer

Table explorer offers an automated way to visually explore table data and create queries based on your selection of table fields.

In table explorer, you select table fields to examine. You can select up to 10 table fields at a time.

Table explorer displays the selected fields as interactive cards with the list of up to 10 most common values for each field, sorted by the `  count  ` column. You can interact with the cards by selecting fields and distinct values which you want to examine more closely. Table explorer creates a data exploration query based on your selection.

You can copy this query into a new query in query editor, or apply the query in table explorer. When you apply the query, table explorer runs it and refreshes the displayed cards with query results. To continue table data exploration, select more fields or values from the refreshed cards.

## Limitations

  - Table explorer is available for BigQuery tables, BigLake tables, external tables, and views.
  - Table explorer lets you explore a single table at a time. The feature does not support simultaneous exploration of multiple tables or generating cross-table operations, for example, `  JOIN  ` operations.
  - Table explorer creates SQL queries that directly reflect your selection of table fields and distinct values. You can execute queries created by table explorer or manually edit them in the query editor. Table explorer does not provide AI-powered assistance to generate, complete, or explain SQL queries.
  - To explore table data and generate queries for tables with column-level access control (ACLs) or restricted user permissions, you must have read access for all selected fields. To run the generated queries, you must have sufficient [permissions](#roles) .

## Pricing

Table explorer runs queries based on your selection of table fields and distinct values to display table exploration results. These queries incur compute pricing charges. Table explorer displays the amount of data that will be processed for each query before you confirm your selection of table fields, triggering the query execution.

You can also incur compute charges if you run a query generated by table explorer.

## Before you begin

### Required roles and permissions

To get the permissions that you need to view table data and generate queries with table explorer, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles :

  - [BigQuery Job User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` ) on the project.
  - [BigQuery Data Viewer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataViewer) ( `  roles/bigquery.dataViewer  ` ) on all tables and views that you want to explore.

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to view table data and generate queries with table explorer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to view table data and generate queries with table explorer:

  - `  bigquery.jobs.create  ` on the project from which the query is being run, regardless of where the data is stored.
  - `  bigquery.tables.getData  ` on all tables and views that you want to explore.

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information about BigQuery Identity and Access Management (IAM), see [Access control with IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

## Explore data in a table to create a query

To explore table data and create a query based on your selection of table fields and values, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to BigQuery Studio.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and then click **Datasets** .

4.  Click **Overview \> Tables** , and then select a table for which you want to create a query.

5.  Click the **Table explorer** tab, and then click **Select fields** .

6.  In the **Select fields** pane, select up to 10 table fields to explore.

7.  For a partitioned table, in the **Partitioning filter** section, set a custom partitioning filter. Partition filters can reduce the billable compute when exploring tables.
    
    1.  Select **Apply custom partitioning filter** .
    
    2.  In the displayed settings fields, configure the partitioning filter.
    
    Display of filter settings depends on the partition type of the table: hour, day, month, year, or range.

8.  Click **Save** .
    
    When you click **Save** , BigQuery runs a query to display common values for the selected fields, which incurs charges. You can see the amount of data which will be processed at the top of the **Select fields** pane.
    
    Table explorer displays the selected fields as cards in a list of up to the ten most common values sorted by the `  Count  ` column. In the **Generated Query** section, you can see a query which you can run to show the same data.

9.  Optional: To modify your results, you can try the following:
    
    1.  In the displayed selected field cards, select distinct values to further filter the data.
    2.  To revert all changes, click **Reset** .
    3.  In the **Generated Query** section, click **Copy to query** to copy the generated code into a new, untitled query in the query editor. In the newly created query tab, you can edit, run, and manage the query.

10. To run the generated query, click **Apply** .
    
    BigQuery executes the generated query and refreshes displayed cards with results of the query.

11. To continue table exploration, select new fields or distinct values from the refreshed displayed cards.

## Troubleshooting

``` text
Access Denied: Project [project_id]: User does not have bigquery.jobs.create
permission in project [project_id].
```

This error occurs when a principal lacks permission to create a query jobs in the project.

**Resolution** : An administrator must grant you the `  bigquery.jobs.create  ` permission on the project you are querying. This permission is required in addition to any permission required to access the queried data.
