# Work with sessions

This document describes how to create, use, terminate, and list your [sessions](/bigquery/docs/sessions-intro) .

Before you complete these steps, ensure you have the necessary [permissions](/bigquery/docs/sessions-intro#roles_and_permissions) .

## Create a session

If you would like to capture a group of your SQL activities, create a BigQuery session. After creating a session, you can run interactive queries in your session until the session [terminates](#terminate-session) . All queries in the session are run (processed) in the location where the session was created.

### Console

In the Google Cloud console, each session is assigned to an editor tab.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  Click add\_box **Compose new query** . A new editor tab opens.

3.  Click **More \> Query settings** . The **Query settings** panel appears.

4.  In the **Session management** section, click **Use session mode** to enable the session mode.

5.  In **Additional settings \> Data location** , select the location. After the session is created, all queries in the session are restricted to this location and the location cannot be changed.

6.  Click **Save** .

7.  [Write a query in the editor tab](/bigquery/docs/sessions-write-queries) and run it. The new session is created after this first query is run.

### bq

Open the [Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?cloudshell=true) and enter the following [`  bq query  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_query) command:

``` text
bq query \
--nouse_legacy_sql \
--create_session
[--location 'SESSION_LOCATION'] \
'SQL_STATEMENT'
```

where:

  - SESSION\_LOCATION : Bind the session to a [physical location](/bigquery/docs/locations) . Restrict all queries in the session to this location. Optional.
  - SQL\_STATEMENT : The first SQL statement for your session.

Your session ID is returned with the results of the query.

### API

Call the [`  jobs.query  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query) method with the following parameters:

``` text
{
  "query": "SQL_STATEMENT",
  "createSession": true,
  ["location": "SESSION_LOCATION"]
}
```

where:

  - SQL\_STATEMENT : The first SQL statement for your session.
  - SESSION\_LOCATION : Bind the session to a [physical location](/bigquery/docs/locations) . Restrict all queries in the session to this location. Optional.

The response body is similar to the following:

``` text
{
  "jobReference": {
    "projectId": "myProject",
    "jobId": "job_123"
  },
  "statistics": {
    "sessionInfo": {
      "sessionId": "CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMDAzYjI0OWQtZ"
    }
  }
}
```

## Run a query in a session

After you create a session, you can run queries in that session:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  Click the editor tab that contains the session.

3.  Add your query to the session and click **Run** .

### bq

Open the [Cloud Shell](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?cloudshell=true) and enter the following [`  bq query  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_query) command:

``` text
bq query \
--nouse_legacy_sql \
--session_id=SESSION_ID \
'SQL_STATEMENT'
```

where:

  - SESSION\_ID : Replace this with the [ID of the session](/bigquery/docs/sessions#get-id) you want to work with.
  - SQL\_STATEMENT : A SQL statement to run in your session.

The results of the query are followed by your session ID.

If you are going to run lots of queries with the Cloud Shell, you can add your session ID to `  [query]  ` in [`  .bigqueryrc  `](/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool#adding_flags_to_bigqueryrc) so that you don't need to copy and paste the session ID into each command.

This is what a session ID looks like in `  .bigqueryrc  ` :

``` text
[query]
--session_id=CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMDAzYjI0OWQtZ
```

After you've added the session ID to `  .bigqueryrc  ` , you can omit the `  --session_id  ` flag from the `  bq query  ` command. If you want to use a different session or if a session terminates, you must update your `  .bigqueryrc  ` file.

### API

Call the [`  jobs.query  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query) method with the following parameters:

``` text
{
  "query": "SQL_STATEMENT",
  "connectionProperties": [{
    "key": "session_id",
    "value": "SESSION_ID"
  }]
}
```

where:

  - SQL\_STATEMENT : The first SQL statement for your session.
  - SESSION\_ID : The [ID of the session](/bigquery/docs/sessions#get-id) .

## Terminate a session

A session can be terminated manually or automatically. The history of a terminated session is available for 20 days after termination.

### Auto-terminate a session

A session is terminated automatically after 24 hours of inactivity or after 7 days, whichever happens first.

### Terminate the current session

You can terminate your current session with a SQL statement or in the Google Cloud console, if the session was created there.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  Find the editor tab that contains your session and close it. The session is terminated.

### SQL

Do the following to terminate your session:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CALL BQ.ABORT_SESSION();
    ```

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### Terminate a session by ID

You can terminate a session using its ID. You don't need to be in the session to terminate it this way.

[Get the session ID](/bigquery/docs/sessions#get-id) , and then run the following statement:

``` text
CALL BQ.ABORT_SESSION(SESSION_ID);
```

Replace SESSION\_ID with the ID of the session to terminate.

## Get the ID of your active session

In some situations, you need to reference a session to continue working within it. For example, if you are working with the Cloud Shell, you must include the session ID each time you run a command for that session.

### Console

You don't need to provide the session ID to run a new query inside a session in the Google Cloud console. You can just continue working in the editor tab that contains the session. However, if you would like to reference your session in the Cloud Shell or an API call, you need to know the ID for the session you created in the console.

Before you complete these steps, make sure that that you have run at least one query in an active session.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  Click the editor tab that contains the session.

3.  In **Query results** , click **Job information** .

4.  In the **Job information** list, search for the session ID:
    
    ``` text
    Session ID: CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMDAzYjI0OWQtZ
    ```

### bq

To run query commands in a session within the Cloud Shell, you need to include the session ID in the command. You can get the session ID when you [create a session](/bigquery/docs/sessions#create-session) or by [listing your sessions](#list-sessions) .

When you create a session with the Cloud Shell, the session ID that is returned is similar to the following:

``` text
In session: CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMDAzYjI0OWQtZ
```

### API

To pass SQL commands into a session with an API call, you need to include the session ID in the API call. You can get the session ID when you [create a session](/bigquery/docs/sessions#create-session) or by [listing your sessions](#list-sessions) .

When you create a session with an API call, the session ID in the response looks similar to the following:

``` text
sessionId: CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMDAzYjI0OWQtZ
```

## List active and inactive sessions

To get session IDs of active and inactive sessions, follow these steps:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, click **Job history** .

4.  Select the type of job history:
    
      - To display information of your recent jobs, click **Personal history** .
      - To display information of recent jobs in your project, click **Project history** .

5.  In the **Session ID** column, you can view session IDs for your jobs.

### SQL

To get a list of your three most recent sessions including the active and terminated sessions, run the following query in the editor tab:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      session_id,
      MAX(creation_time) AS last_modified_time
    FROM region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEW
    WHERE
      session_id IS NOT NULL
      AND creation_time > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 20 DAY)
    GROUP BY session_id
    ORDER BY last_modified_time DESC;
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  VIEW  ` : the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` view:
          - [`  JOBS_BY_USER  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs-by-user#schema) : returns only the jobs created by the current user in the current project
          - [`  SESSIONS_BY_USER  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-sessions-by-user#schema) : returns only the sessions created by the current user in the current project
          - [`  SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-sessions-by-project#schema) : returns all sessions in the current project

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

The result is similar to the following:

``` text
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| session_id                                        | last_modified_time  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMGQ5YWWYzZmE0YjhkMDBm     | 2021-06-01 23:04:26 |
| CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMDAzYjI0OWQtZTczwZjA1NDc2 | 2021-05-30 22:43:02 |
| CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQY2MzLTg4ZDEtYzVhOWZiYmM5NzZk  | 2021-04-07 22:31:21 |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## View the history of a session

A session captures your SQL activities within a timeframe. This information is stored in the session's history. Session history lets you track changes you've made in the session. If a job fails or succeeds, it is recorded in the session history so you can go back later and see what you did.

### Console

To view the history of a session in the Google Cloud console, you can filter your **Personal History** or **Project History** by session ID to view all SQL queries run in a specific session.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, click **Job history** .

4.  Select the type of job history you want to view:
    
      - To display information of your recent jobs, click **Personal history** .
      - To display information of recent jobs in your project, click **Project history** .

5.  Click filter\_list **Filter** and then select **Session ID** .

6.  In the **Session ID** field, search for the session ID:
    
    ``` text
    Session ID: CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMDAzYjI0OWQtZ
    ```

### SQL

To view historical data for a specific session, first [get your session ID](/bigquery/docs/sessions#get-id) , then follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEW
    WHERE
      session_info.session_id = 'SESSION_ID';
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - VIEW : the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` view to work with
        
        Select one of the following views:
        
          - [`  JOBS_BY_USER  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs#schema) : returns only the jobs created by the current user in the current project
          - [`  SESSIONS_BY_USER  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-sessions-by-user#schema) : returns only the sessions created by the current user in the current project
          - [`  SESSIONS_BY_PROJECT  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-sessions-by-project#schema) : returns all sessions in the current project
    
      - SESSION\_ID : the ID of the session for which to retrieve historical data

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

#### Example

The following returns the history for a session that has the session ID `  CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMDAzYjI0  ` . You can replace this session ID with your own.

``` text
SELECT
  creation_time, query
FROM
  region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_USER
WHERE
  session_info.session_id = 'CgwKCmZhbGl1LXRlc3QQARokMDAzYjI0'
  AND creation_time > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 20 DAY);
```

The result is similar to the following:

``` text
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|    creation_time    |                                          query                                           |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2021-06-01 23:04:26 | SELECT * FROM Purchases;                                                                 |
| 2021-06-01 23:02:51 | CREATE TEMP TABLE Purchases(total INT64) AS SELECT * FROM UNNEST([10,23,3,14,55]) AS a;  |
+---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
