The Google Cloud [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension lets you do the following in VS Code:

  - Develop and execute BigQuery notebooks.
  - Browse, inspect, and preview BigQuery datasets.

## Before you begin

1.  In your local terminal, check to make sure you have [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or later installed on your system:
    
    ``` text
    python3 --version
    ```

2.  [Install the Google Cloud CLI](/sdk/docs/install) .

3.  In your local terminal, [initialize the gcloud CLI](/sdk/docs/initializing) :
    
    ``` text
    gcloud init
    ```

4.  Configure a default project:
    
    ``` text
    gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
    ```
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with your default project.

5.  Set up [Application Default Credentials](/bigquery/docs/authentication) :
    
    ``` text
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

6.  [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) .

7.  Open VS Code, and then in the activity bar, click **Extensions** .

8.  Using the search bar, find the **Jupyter** extension, and then click **Install** . The BigQuery features in VS Code require the Jupyter extension by Microsoft as a dependency.

## Install the Google Cloud extension

1.  Open VS Code, and then in the activity bar, click **Extensions** .

2.  Using the search bar, find the **Google Cloud Code** extension, and then click **Install** .

3.  If prompted, restart VS Code.

The **Google Cloud Code** icon is now visible in the activity bar.

## Configure the extension

1.  Open VS Code, and then in the activity bar, click **Google Cloud Code** .
2.  Open the **BigQuery Notebooks** section.
3.  Click **Login to Google Cloud** . You are redirected to sign in with your credentials.
4.  Use the top-level application taskbar to navigate to **Code \> Settings \> Settings \> Extensions** .
5.  Find **Google Cloud Code** , and click the **Manage** icon to open the menu.
6.  Select **Settings** .
7.  For the **Cloud Code: Project** setting, enter the name of the Google Cloud project that you want to use to execute notebooks and display BigQuery datasets.
8.  For the **Cloud Code \> Beta: BigQuery Region** setting, enter a [BigQuery location](/bigquery/docs/locations#supported_locations) . The extension displays datasets from this location.

## Develop BigQuery notebooks

1.  Open VS Code, and then in the activity bar, click **Google Cloud Code** .

2.  Open the **BigQuery Notebooks** section, and click **BigQuery Notebook** . A new `  .ipynb  ` file containing sample code is created and opened in the editor.

3.  In the new notebook, click **Select Kernel** , and select a Python kernel. BigQuery notebooks require a local Python kernel for execution. You can create a new virtual environment or use one of the existing ones.

4.  If it hasn't already been installed in your virtual environment, install the `  bigframes  ` client library:
    
    1.  Open the **Terminal** window.
    2.  Run the `  pip install bigframes  ` command.

You can now write and execute code in your BigQuery notebook.

## Explore and preview BigQuery datasets

1.  Open VS Code, and then in the activity bar, click **Google Cloud Code** .
2.  To see datasets and tables from your specified project and region, open the **BigQuery Datasets** section. BigQuery public datasets are also visible.
3.  To open a new tab in the editor, click any table name. This tab contains the table details, schema, and preview.

## Pricing

The Visual Studio Code extension is free, but you are charged for any Google Cloud services (BigQuery, Dataproc, Cloud Storage) that you use.
