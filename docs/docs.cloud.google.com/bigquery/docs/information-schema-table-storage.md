# TABLE\_STORAGE view

The `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` view provides a current snapshot of storage usage for tables and materialized views. When you query the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` view, the query results contain one row for each table or materialized view for the current project.

The data in the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` view is not kept in real time, and updates are typically delayed by a few seconds to a few minutes. Storage changes that are caused by partition or table expiration alone, or that are caused by modifications to the dataset time travel window, might take up to a day to be reflected in the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` view. In cases of dataset deletion where the dataset contains more than 1,000 tables, this view won't reflect the change until the [time travel window](/bigquery/docs/time-travel#time_travel) for the deleted dataset has passed.

The table storage views give you a convenient way to observe your current storage consumption, and in addition provide details on whether your storage uses logical uncompressed bytes, physical compressed bytes, or time travel bytes. This information can help you with tasks like planning for future growth and understanding the update patterns for tables.

## Data included in the `     *_BYTES    ` columns

The `  *_BYTES  ` columns in the table storage views include information about your use of storage bytes. This information is determined by looking at your storage usage for materialized views and the following types of tables:

  - Permanent tables created through any of the methods described in [Create and use tables](/bigquery/docs/tables) .
  - Temporary tables created in [sessions](/bigquery/docs/sessions-write-queries#use_temporary_tables_in_sessions) . These tables are placed into datasets with generated names like "\_c018003e063d09570001ef33ae401fad6ab92a6a".
  - Temporary tables created in [multi-statement queries](/bigquery/docs/multi-statement-queries#temporary_tables) ("scripts"). These tables are placed into datasets with generated names like "\_script72280c173c88442c3a7200183a50eeeaa4073719".

Data stored in the [query results cache](/bigquery/docs/writing-results#temporary_and_permanent_tables) is not billed to you and so is not included in the `  *_BYTES  ` column values.

Clones and snapshots show `  *_BYTES  ` column values as if they were complete tables, rather than showing the delta from the storage used by the base table, so they are an over-estimation. Your bill does account correctly for this delta in storage usage. For more information on the delta bytes stored and billed by clones and snapshots, see the [`  TABLE_STORAGE_USAGE_TIMELINE  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-table-storage-usage) .

## Forecast storage billing

In order to forecast the monthly storage billing for a dataset, you can use either the `  logical  ` or `  physical *_BYTES  ` columns in this view, depending on the [dataset storage billing model](/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro#dataset_storage_billing_models) used by the dataset. Please note that this is only a rough forecast, and the precise billing amounts are calculated based on the usage by BigQuery storage billing infrastructure and visible in Cloud Billing.

For datasets that use a logical billing model, you can forecast your monthly storage costs as follows:

(( `  ACTIVE_LOGICAL_BYTES  ` value / `  POW  ` (1024, 3)) \* active logical bytes pricing) + (( `  LONG_TERM_LOGICAL_BYTES  ` value / `  POW  ` (1024, 3)) \* long-term logical bytes pricing)

The `  ACTIVE_LOGICAL_BYTES  ` value for a table reflects the active bytes currently used by that table.

For datasets that use a physical billing model, you can forecast your storage costs as follows:

(( `  ACTIVE_PHYSICAL_BYTES + FAIL_SAFE_PHYSICAL_BYTES  ` value / `  POW  ` (1024, 3)) \* active physical bytes pricing) + (( `  LONG_TERM_PHYSICAL_BYTES  ` value / `  POW  ` (1024, 3)) \* long-term physical bytes pricing)

The `  ACTIVE_PHYSICAL_BYTES  ` value for a table reflects the active bytes currently used by that table plus the bytes used for time travel for that table.

To see the active bytes of the table alone, subtract the `  TIME_TRAVEL_PHYSICAL_BYTES  ` value from the `  ACTIVE_PHYSICAL_BYTES  ` value.

For more information, see [Storage pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#storage) .

**Note:** The view names `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` and `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE_BY_PROJECT  ` are synonymous and can be used interchangeably.

## Understanding byte values versus billing units

The `  *_BYTES  ` columns in the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` views provide a snapshot of your current storage consumption in bytes. This tells you how much data you are storing at that moment.

However, BigQuery storage billing, as shown in your Cloud Billing reports, is not based on this instantaneous size alone. Instead, billing is calculated based on the amount of data stored over time. The standard billing units are GiB-month or TiB-month.

For example, storing 1 GiB for any full calendar month results in 1 GiB-month of usage, regardless of whether the month has 28 to 31 days. Similarly, storing data for just part of the month is prorated. Storing 31 GiB for a single day in a 31-day month is approximately 1 GiB-month, just as storing 28 GiB for a single day in a 28-day month is also approximately 1 GiB-month.

While the byte values in `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` are essential inputs for estimating potential costs, your actual bill reflects the continuous calculation of `  (bytes stored * duration stored)  ` . The values from this view are not expected to directly match the line items in your billing report, which are aggregated over the billing period.

For comprehensive details about how storage costs are calculated, see [Storage pricing](/bigquery/pricing#storage-pricing) page.

## Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to query the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` view, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Metadata Viewer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.metadataViewer) ( `  roles/bigquery.metadataViewer  ` ) IAM role on the project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to query the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` view. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to query the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE  ` view:

  - `  bigquery.tables.get  `
  - `  bigquery.tables.list  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of using a wildcard ( `  SELECT *  ` ). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from breaking if the underlying schema changes.

## Scope and syntax

Queries against this view must include a [region qualifier](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#syntax) . The following table explains the region scope for this view:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>View name</th>
<th>Resource scope</th>
<th>Region scope</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       [`               PROJECT_ID              `.]`region-               REGION              `.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE[_BY_PROJECT]      </code></td>
<td>Project level</td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">         REGION       </code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Replace the following:

  - Optional: `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the ID of your Google Cloud project. If not specified, the default project is used.
  - `  REGION  ` : any [dataset region name](/bigquery/docs/locations) . For example, ``  `region-us`  `` .
    **Note:** You must use [a region qualifier](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#region_qualifier) to query `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` views. The location of the query execution must match the region of the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` view.

The following example shows how to return storage information for tables in a specified project and region:

``` text
SELECT * FROM `myProject`.`region-REGION`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE;
```

The following example shows how to return storage information for tables in the current project in a specified region:

``` text
SELECT * FROM `region-REGION`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE_BY_PROJECT;
```

## Examples

##### Example 1:

The following example shows you the total logical bytes billed for the current project.

``` text
SELECT
  SUM(total_logical_bytes) AS total_logical_bytes
FROM
  `region-REGION`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE;
```

The result is similar to the following:

``` text
+---------------------+
| total_logical_bytes |
+---------------------+
| 971329178274633     |
+---------------------+
```

##### Example 2:

The following example shows different storage bytes in GiB at the dataset(s) level for current project.

``` text
SELECT
  table_schema AS dataset_name,
  -- Logical
  SUM(total_logical_bytes) / power(1024, 3) AS total_logical_gib,  
  SUM(active_logical_bytes) / power(1024, 3) AS active_logical_gib, 
  SUM(long_term_logical_bytes) / power(1024, 3) AS long_term_logical_gib, 
  -- Physical
  SUM(total_physical_bytes) / power(1024, 3) AS total_physical_gib,
  SUM(active_physical_bytes) / power(1024, 3) AS active_physical_gib,
  SUM(active_physical_bytes - time_travel_physical_bytes) / power(1024, 3) AS active_no_tt_physical_gib,
  SUM(long_term_physical_bytes) / power(1024, 3) AS long_term_physical_gib,
  SUM(time_travel_physical_bytes) / power(1024, 3) AS time_travel_physical_gib,
  SUM(fail_safe_physical_bytes) / power(1024, 3) AS fail_safe_physical_gib 
FROM
  `region-REGION`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_STORAGE 
WHERE 
  table_type ='BASE TABLE'
GROUP BY 
  table_schema  
ORDER BY 
  dataset_name 
```

##### Example 3:

The following example shows you how to forecast the price difference per dataset between logical and physical billing models for the next 30 days. This example assumes that future storage usage is constant over the next 30 days from the moment the query was run. Note that the forecast is limited to base tables, it excludes all other types of tables within a dataset.

The prices used in the pricing variables for this query are for the `  us-central1  ` region. If you want to run this query for a different region, update the pricing variables appropriately. See [Storage pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#storage) for pricing information.
