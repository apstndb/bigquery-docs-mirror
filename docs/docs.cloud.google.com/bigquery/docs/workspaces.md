This document shows you how to work with workspaces in BigQuery, including the following tasks:

  - Creating workspaces
  - Deleting workspaces
  - Working with files in workspaces
  - Performing version control on files in workspaces

## Before you begin

If you haven't done so already, [create a BigQuery repository](/bigquery/docs/repositories) .

### Required roles

Access to workspaces is determined by roles granted on their parent repository. For more information, see [Required roles](/bigquery/docs/repositories#required-roles) .

## Create a workspace

Workspace creation is handled differently based on whether you are using a BigQuery repository or a third-party repository.

## Use version control with a file

This section shows you how to use version control in BigQuery to keep track of files in workspaces.

BigQuery uses Git to keep track of each change made to the files inside a repository. In a BigQuery repository, you interact directly with the Git repository. In a connected repository, you interact with the default branch of the remote repository that you configured when you [connected the repository](/bigquery/docs/repositories#connect-third-party) .

BigQuery displays version control options based on the status of changes in your workspace. For example, BigQuery displays the commit option only when there are uncommitted local changes in your workspace. When the files in your workspace are an exact copy of your default or default branch, BigQuery displays the **Up to date** status.

BigQuery displays the following version control options:

  - Commit X change(s)  
    Commit the X number of local changes in your workspace or selected changed files. BigQuery displays the uncommitted changes.
  - Push to default branch  
    Push your committed changes to your default branch. This option is available in a repository if you have no uncommitted changes in your workspace and there are unpushed commits.
  - Push to `  your-branch-name  `  
    Push your committed changes to `  your-branch-name  ` . This option is available in a repository [connected to a third-party Git repository](/bigquery/docs/repositories#connect-third-party) if you have no uncommitted changes in your workspace. The remote branch name in the third-party repository is the same as the BigQuery workspace ID.
  - Pull from default branch  
    Update your workspaces with recent changes from your default branch. This option is available in a repository if you have no uncommitted changes in your workspace.
  - Pull from `  your-branch-name  `  
    Update your workspace with recent changes from `  your-branch-name  ` . This option is available in a repository [connected to a third-party Git repository](/bigquery/docs/repositories#connect-third-party) if you have no uncommitted changes in your workspace. The remote branch name in the third-party repository is the same as the BigQuery workspace ID.
  - Revert to last commit  
    Restore the files in your workspace to their state from your last commit.

### Pull changes

If your workspace is out of sync with your repository, BigQuery displays the **Pull** option.

To pull changes from your repository to your workspace, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and then click **Repositories** to open the **Repositories** tab in the details pane.

4.  Select the repository that contains the workspace that you want to work with.

5.  Locate the workspace and then click **Open** .
    
    This opens the workspace in the folder\_data **Git repository** pane.

6.  In the workspace pane, do the following:
    
    1.  If you are in a BigQuery repository, click **Pull from default branch** .
    
    2.  If you are in a repository [connected to a third-party Git repository](/bigquery/docs/repositories#connect-third-party) , do one of the following:
        
        1.  Click **Pull from default branch** to pull from the default branch of the third-party repository.
        2.  Click **Pull from `  your-branch-name  `** to pull from the branch of the third-party repository that corresponds to the current workspace.

### Commit changes

After you make a change in a workspace, BigQuery displays the **Commit** option. You can commit all local changes or selected files. Files that you have added or modified are identified with a blue dot next to them in the workspace pane.

To commit changes from your workspace to your repository, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

7.  In the **Commit changes** pane, do the following:
    
    1.  Select the changed files that you want to commit.
        
        If you don't select any files, BigQuery commits all local changes. You can filter changed files by file state, filename, and path.
    
    2.  In the **Add a commit message** field, type a description for your commit.
    
    3.  Click **Commit All changes** , or **Commit X changes** .
        
        The button name depends on your selection of files to commit.

### Resolve merge conflicts

A merge conflict can happen when a local change in your workspace is incompatible with a change that has been made to the default default branch of your repository. Merge conflicts usually occur when multiple users simultaneously edit the same file.

You usually encounter a merge conflict when you pull from a branch after a different user has pushed a conflicting change to the same branch. You need to resolve a merge conflict manually by editing the affected file.

The following code sample shows a merge conflict displayed in a SQL file:

``` text
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    SELECT 1 as CustomerOrders
    =======
    SELECT 1 as Orders
    >>>>>>> refs/heads/main
```

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and then click **Repositories** to open the **Repositories** tab in the details pane.

4.  Select the repository that contains the workspace that you want to work with.

5.  Locate the workspace and then click **Open** .
    
    This opens the workspace in the folder\_data **Git repository** pane.

6.  Select the affected file and edit it with your chosen changes.

7.  [Commit changes](#commit) .

8.  Optional: [Push changes](#push) .
