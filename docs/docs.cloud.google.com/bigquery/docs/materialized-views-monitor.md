# Monitor materialized views

You can monitor [materialized view](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro) by using tools that include information schema and log monitoring.

To create a list of materialized views, see [List materialized views](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-manage#list) .

## Materialized view information schema view

To discover materialized views, query the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-tables) . To retrieve the properties of a materialized view, query the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_OPTIONS  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-table-options) .

Materialized views are not listed in the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VIEWS  ` views](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-views) table.

## Monitor automatic refresh

This section describes how to view [refresh details for materialized views](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-manage#refresh) .

### View last refresh status

To retrieve the current status of materialized views, call the [`  tables.get  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/get) , or query the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.MATERIALIZED_VIEWS  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-materialized-views) .

For example:

``` text
SELECT
  table_name, last_refresh_time, refresh_watermark, last_refresh_status
FROM
  `DATASET`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.MATERIALIZED_VIEWS;
```

If the value for `  last_refresh_status  ` is not `  NULL  ` , the last automatic refresh job failed. Manual refresh requests are not reflected here. Changes to base tables can invalidate a materialized view definition, resulting in an error during automatic refresh. For more information, see [Incremental updates](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-use#incremental_updates) . For example, if a column that is referenced by the materialized view gets dropped from the base table, the `  last_refresh_status  ` field returns an `  invalidQuery  ` error. For more information, see [Error messages](/bigquery/docs/error-messages) .

### List automatic refresh jobs

To list materialized view automatic refresh jobs, call the [`  jobs.list  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/list) . To retrieve details about the jobs, call the [`  jobs.get  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/get) . You can also query the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_*  ` views](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs) to retrieve job details. Automatic refresh jobs contain the `  materialized_view_refresh  ` prefix within the [job ID](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#FIELDS.id) and are started by a BigQuery administrator account.

For example:

``` text
SELECT
  job_id, total_slot_ms, total_bytes_processed,
  materialized_view_statistics.materialized_view[SAFE_OFFSET(0)].rejected_reason
  AS full_refresh_reason
FROM
  `region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT`
WHERE
  job_id LIKE '%materialized_view_refresh_%'
LIMIT 10;
```

To monitor the cost of refresh jobs and adjust the automatic refresh interval if needed, view the `  total_bytes_processed  ` and `  total_slot_ms  ` fields.

For example, if the ingestion rate in the base tables is relatively small, it makes sense to refresh the view less often. If the underlying data changes quickly, it makes sense to refresh more often.

If the base tables ingest data at predefined points in time, such as by using a nightly extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipeline, consider taking control of the materialized view maintenance schedule as follows:

1.  [Disable automatic refresh](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-manage#automatic-refresh) .

2.  [Perform a manual refresh](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-manage#manual-refresh) , either as part of the ETL pipeline, or by configuring a scheduled query at specific times of the day.

Table truncation, partition truncation, partition expiration, and `  UPDATE  ` , `  DELETE  ` , and `  MERGE  ` data manipulation language (DML) statements on a base table can all invalidate their materialized views. If the materialized view is partitioned, the modified partitions are invalidated; otherwise, the entire materialized view is invalidated. Therefore, you might want to batch your DML statements and perform the manual refresh at the end of your query.

For more information on pricing for materialized views, see [materialized views pricing](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#materialized_views_pricing) .

### Monitor failed materialized views refresh

You can create automation to monitor failed materialized view refreshes and send alerts using [BigQuery audit logs](/bigquery/docs/reference/auditlogs) in [Cloud Logging](/logging/docs/overview) . BigQuery creates log entries for materialized views refresh jobs, including failures. [Logs Explorer](/logging/docs/view/logs-explorer-interface) in the Google Cloud console helps you retrieve, view, and analyze log entries. These entries are stored in [log buckets](/logging/docs/store-log-entries) , which are the containers that Cloud Logging uses to store your log data.

To create a metric and an alert, follow these steps:

### Console

Follow these steps to create a log-based metric that sends an alert when more than three materialized view refreshes fail in a 10-minute interval.

**Create a log-based metric**

1.  To set up Logs Explorer, follow the instructions in [View and analyze logs](/logging/docs/view/logs-explorer-interface#getting_started) .

2.  In Logs Explorer, confirm that the **Show query** setting is toggled on.
    
    When you use the Google Cloud console, the scope of the project is the single project that is selected in the Google Cloud console project picker. To learn how to add additional projects, see [Add projects to a metrics scope](/monitoring/settings/multiple-projects#add-monitored-project) .

3.  In the **Query** pane, paste the following query to capture all failed automatic materialized view refresh jobs in the current project's logging scope:
    
    ``` text
    severity: "ERROR"
    protoPayload.metadata.jobChange.after: "DONE"
    protoPayload.metadata.jobChange.job.jobConfig.queryConfig.query =~ "CALL BQ.REFRESH_MATERIALIZED_VIEW\('.*'\)"
    protoPayload.resourceName =~ ".*materialized_view_refresh_[\w]"
    ```

4.  Click **Run query** .

5.  Click **Actions** , and then select **Create metric** .

6.  To create an alert based on the number of errors, for the metric type select **Counter** and enter a **Log-based metric name** and **Description** for your metric. The **Units** field can be left blank.

7.  To define your metric filter in the **Filter selection** section, apply the following settings:
    
      - Use the **Select project or log bucket** menu to choose whether the metric counts the log entries in your Google Cloud project or only those log entries in a specific log bucket.
    
      - Create a filter that collects only the log entries that you want to count in your metric using the [logging query language](/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language) . You can also use regular expressions to create your metric's filters.
    
      - To see which log entries match your filter, click **Preview logs** .

8.  Click **Add label** .

9.  Enter a unique **Label name** and **Description** to help you identify your metric. Leave **Label type** as **String** , the default.

10. For **Field name** , enter the following string:
    
    ``` text
    protoPayload.metadata.jobChange.job.jobConfig.queryConfig.query
    ```

11. For **Regular expression** , enter the following string:
    
    ``` text
    CALL BQ.REFRESH_MATERIALIZED_VIEW\('(.*)'\)
    ```

12. Click **Done** and click **Create metric** .

For more information about counter metrics, see [Configure counter metrics](/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics/counter-metrics) .

**Create an alert**

Complete the following steps to create an alert policy that specifies the conditions and sends an email when three materialized view refresh jobs fail within a ten-minute period. This option provides added flexibility when configuring an alerting policy. If you create a logs-based metric directly, an alert is sent each time a failed materialized view refresh error is present in the logs.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Log-based Metrics** page.

2.  Adjacent to your user-defined logs-based metric for materialized view refreshes, click more\_vert **More actions** \> **Create alert from metric** .

3.  In **Select a metric** , select the name of the metric you specified previously for **Log-based metric name** .

4.  In **Add filters** , add an additional filter to the alert based on the naming convention of the materialized view defined in the **Regular expression** field.
    
    This step is useful if you need to define a separate notification channel for multiple teams that use the same project but are logically divided by the materialized view naming convention. For more information about alert criteria, see [Filter charted data](/monitoring/charts/metrics-selector#filter-option) in "Select metrics when using Metrics Explorer".

5.  In the **Rolling window** setting of the **Transform data** section, specify a value greater than 10 minutes to ensure that multiple log entries matching your filter are counted, and click **Next** .

6.  Specify **Threshold value** , `  3  ` for example, and optionally, configure the **Alert trigger** and **Threshold position** fields. Click **Next** .

7.  Choose a notification channel for alerting.

8.  Click **Create policy** .

When the number of failed materialized view refreshes exceeds your threshold, your notification channel is alerted.

### Terraform

You can create a custom metric, alert policy, notification channel, and logging scope by using Terraform. The following Terraform sample uses a query to monitor and log each failed materialized view refresh job.

``` text
resource "google_logging_metric" "failed_mv_refresh_metric" {
project = var.project_id
name    = var.logging_metric_name
filter = trimspace(<<EOT
  severity="ERROR"
  AND protoPayload.metadata.jobChange.after="DONE"
  AND protoPayload.metadata.jobChange.job.jobConfig.queryConfig.query=~"CALL BQ.REFRESH_MATERIALIZED_VIEW\('.*'\)"
  AND protoPayload.resourceName=~".*materialized_view_refresh_[\\w]"
  EOT
  )
metric_descriptor {
  metric_kind  = "DELTA"
  value_type   = "INT64"
  unit         = "1"
  display_name = "Failed Materialized View Refresh Count"

  labels {
    key          = "materialized_view_name"
    value_type   = "STRING"
    description  = "The name of the materialized view that failed to refresh."
  }
}
label_extractors = {
  "materialized_view_name" = "REGEXP_EXTRACT(protoPayload.metadata.jobChange.job.jobConfig.queryConfig.query, \"CALL BQ\\.REFRESH_MATERIALIZED_VIEW\\('(.*)'\\)\")"
}
}
```

The following sample creates an alert which can be used to send an email when the number of failed materialized view refresh jobs exceeds a threshold.

``` text
resource "google_monitoring_alert_policy" "failed_mv_refresh_alert" {
project      = var.project_id
display_name = var.alert_policy_display_name
combiner     = "OR"

conditions {
  display_name = "Condition: Materialized View Refresh Failure Count Exceeds Threshold"

  condition_threshold {
    filter = "metric.type=\"logging.googleapis.com/user/${google_logging_metric.failed_mv_refresh_metric.name}\" AND resource.type=\"bigquery_project\""

    duration = "${var.alert_duration_seconds}s"

    comparison = "COMPARISON_GT"

    threshold_value = var.alert_threshold_count

    aggregations {
      alignment_period   = "${var.alert_rolling_window_seconds}s"
      per_series_aligner = "ALIGN_DELTA"
      cross_series_reducer = "REDUCE_SUM"
      group_by_fields        = []
    }

    trigger {
      count = 1
    }
  }
}

notification_channels = [
  google_monitoring_notification_channel.email_channel.id,
]
}
```

## Monitor materialized view usage

To view the materialized view usage for a query job, you can call the [`  jobs.get  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/get) or query the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_*  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs) , and view the `  materialized_view_statistics  ` field, which provides details about the use of materialized views by the query, including the following details:

  - Whether the materialized view was used.
  - If the materialized view was not used, [the reason it was rejected](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#rejectedreason) .

For example:

``` text
SELECT
  job_id, materialized_view_statistics
FROM
  region-US.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE
  job_id = '<my-query-job-id>';
```

To view the usage of a materialized view over time, query the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_*  ` views](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs) .

For example, the following query returns a summary of recent query jobs that use the target materialized view:

``` text
SELECT
  mv.table_reference.dataset_id,
  mv.table_reference.table_id,
  MAX(job.creation_time) latest_job_time,
  COUNT(job_id) job_count
FROM
  region-US.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT job,
  UNNEST(materialized_view_statistics.materialized_view) mv
WHERE
  job.creation_time > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL 7 DAY)
  AND mv.table_reference.dataset_id = 'MY_DATASET'
  AND mv.table_reference.table_id = 'MY_MATERIALIZED_VIEW'
  AND mv.chosen = TRUE
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

## Troubleshoot slow queries with materialized views

If your query uses materialized views and is running slower than expected, do the following:

1.  Verify that the intended materialized views are actually being used by the query. For detailed instructions, see [Monitor materialized view usage](#monitor_materialized_view_usage) .
2.  [Check the freshness of your materialized view](#view_last_refresh_status) .
3.  Review the materialized view definition and the data it references and consider [techniques to optimize your materialized view usage](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-create#considerations_when_creating_materialized_views) .
