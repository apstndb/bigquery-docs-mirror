# Create logical views

This document describes how to create logical views in BigQuery.

You can create a logical view in the following ways:

  - Using the Google Cloud console.
  - Using the bq command-line tool's `  bq mk  ` command.
  - Calling the [`  tables.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/tables/insert) API method.
  - Using the client libraries.
  - Submitting a [`  CREATE VIEW  `](/bigquery/docs/data-definition-language#create_view_statement) data definition language (DDL) statement.

## View limitations

BigQuery views are subject to the following limitations:

  - Views are read-only. For example, you can't run queries that insert, update, or delete data.
  - The dataset that contains your view and the dataset that contains the tables referenced by the view must be in the same [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) .
  - A reference inside of a view must be qualified with a dataset. The default dataset doesn't affect a view body.
  - You cannot use the `  TableDataList  ` JSON API method to retrieve data from a view. For more information, see [Tabledata: list](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tabledata/list) .
  - You cannot mix GoogleSQL and legacy SQL queries when using views. A GoogleSQL query cannot reference a view defined using legacy SQL syntax.
  - You cannot reference [query parameters](/bigquery/docs/parameterized-queries) in views.
  - The schemas of the underlying tables are stored with the view when the view is created. If columns are added, deleted, or modified after the view is created, the view isn't automatically updated and the reported schema will remain inaccurate until the view SQL definition is changed or the view is recreated. Even though the reported schema may be inaccurate, all submitted queries produce accurate results.
  - You cannot automatically update a legacy SQL view to GoogleSQL syntax. To modify the query used to define a view, you can use the following:
      - The [**Edit query**](/bigquery/docs/updating-views#update-sql) option in the Google Cloud console
      - The [`  bq update --view  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_update) command in the bq command-line tool
      - The [BigQuery Client libraries](/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries)
      - The [update](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/update) or [patch](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/patch) API methods.
  - You cannot include a temporary user-defined function or a temporary table in the SQL query that defines a view.
  - You cannot reference a view in a [wildcard table](/bigquery/docs/querying-wildcard-tables) query.

For information about quotas and limits that apply to views, see [View limits](/bigquery/quotas#view_limits) .

## Before you begin

Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that give users the necessary permissions to perform each task in this document.

### Required permissions

Views are treated as table resources in BigQuery, so creating a view requires the same permissions as creating a table. You must also have permissions to query any tables that are referenced by the view's SQL query.

To create a view, you need the `  bigquery.tables.create  ` IAM permission. The `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` predefined IAM role includes the permissions that you need to create a view.

Additionally, if you have the `  bigquery.datasets.create  ` permission, you can create views in the datasets that you create. To create a view for data that you don't own, you must have `  bigquery.tables.getData  ` permission for that table.

For more information on IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

**Note:** To create or update an [authorized view](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views) or a view in an [authorized dataset](/bigquery/docs/authorized-datasets#create_or_update_view) , you need additional permissions. For more information, see [required permissions for authorized views](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views#required_permissions) and [required permissions for views in authorized datasets](/bigquery/docs/authorized-datasets#permissions_datasets) .

## View naming

When you create a view in BigQuery, the view name must be unique per dataset. The view name can:

  - Contain characters with a total of up to 1,024 UTF-8 bytes.
  - Contain Unicode characters in category L (letter), M (mark), N (number), Pc (connector, including underscore), Pd (dash), Zs (space). For more information, see [General Category](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#General_Category) .

The following are all examples of valid view names: `  view 01  ` , `  ग्राहक  ` , `  00_お客様  ` , `  étudiant-01  ` .

Caveats:

  - Table names are case-sensitive by default. `  mytable  ` and `  MyTable  ` can coexist in the same dataset, unless they are part of a [dataset with case-sensitivity turned off](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#creating_a_case-insensitive_dataset) .

  - Some view names and view name prefixes are reserved. If you receive an error saying that your view name or prefix is reserved, then select a different name and try again.

  - If you include multiple dot operators ( `  .  ` ) in a sequence, the duplicate operators are implicitly stripped.
    
    For example, this: `  project_name....dataset_name..table_name  `
    
    Becomes this: `  project_name.dataset_name.table_name  `

## Create a view

You can create a view by composing a SQL query that is used to define the data accessible to the view. The SQL query must consist of a `  SELECT  ` statement. Other statement types (such as DML statements) and [multi-statement queries](/bigquery/docs/multi-statement-queries) aren't allowed in view queries.

To create a view:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  Click add\_box **SQL query** .

3.  In the query editor, enter a valid SQL query.
    
    Alternatively, you can [open a saved query](/bigquery/docs/work-with-saved-queries#open_a_saved_query_version_as_a_new_query) .

4.  Click **Save \> Save view** .

5.  In the **Save view** dialog:
    
      - In the **Project** menu, select a project to store the view.
      - In the **Dataset** menu, select a dataset or create a new dataset to store the view. The destination dataset for a saved view must be in the same [region](/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations) as the source.
      - In the **Table** field, enter the name of the view.
      - Click **Save** .

**Note:** When you create a view using Google Cloud console, you cannot add a label, description, or expiration time. You can add these optional properties when you create a view using the API or bq command-line tool. After you create a view using the Google Cloud console, you can add an expiration, description, and labels. For more information, see [Updating views](/bigquery/docs/updating-views) .

### SQL

Use the [`  CREATE VIEW  ` statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_view_statement) . The following example creates a view named `  usa_male_names  ` from the USA names public dataset:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE VIEW mydataset.usa_male_names(name, number) AS (
      SELECT
        name,
        number
      FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
      WHERE
        gender = 'M'
      ORDER BY
        number DESC
    );
    ```

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### bq

Use the [`  bq mk  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_mk) with the `  --view  ` flag. For GoogleSQL queries, add the `  --use_legacy_sql  ` flag and set it to `  false  ` . Some optional parameters include `  --add_tags  ` , `  --expiration  ` , `  --description  ` , and `  --label  ` . For a full list of parameters, see the [`  bq mk  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_mk) reference.

If your query references external user-defined function (UDF) resources stored in Cloud Storage or in local files, use the `  --view_udf_resource  ` flag to specify those resources. The `  --view_udf_resource  ` flag is not demonstrated here. For more information about using UDFs, see [UDFs](/bigquery/docs/user-defined-functions) .

If you are creating a view in a project other than your default project, specify the project ID using the `  --project_id  ` flag.

**Note:** The dataset that contains your view and the dataset that contains the tables referenced by the view must be in the same [location](/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations) .

``` text
bq mk \
--use_legacy_sql=false \
--view_udf_resource=PATH_TO_FILE \
--expiration=INTEGER \
--description="DESCRIPTION" \
--label=KEY_1:VALUE_1 \
--add_tags=KEY_2:VALUE_2[,...] \
--view='QUERY' \
--project_id=PROJECT_ID \
DATASET.VIEW
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PATH_TO_FILE  ` is the URI or local file system path to a code file to be loaded and evaluated immediately as a UDF resource used by the view. Repeat the flag to specify multiple files.
  - `  INTEGER  ` sets the lifetime (in seconds) for the view. If `  INTEGER  ` is `  0  ` , the view doesn't expire. If you don't include the `  --expiration  ` flag, BigQuery creates the view with the dataset's default table lifetime.
  - `  DESCRIPTION  ` is a description of the view in quotes.
  - `  KEY_1:VALUE_1  ` is the key-value pair that represents a [label](/bigquery/docs/labels) . Repeat the `  --label  ` flag to specify multiple labels.
  - `  KEY_2:VALUE_2  ` is the key-value pair that represents a [tag](/bigquery/docs/labels) . Add multiple tags under the same flag with commas between key:value pairs.
  - `  QUERY  ` is a valid query.
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` is your project ID (if you don't have a default project configured).
  - `  DATASET  ` is a dataset in your project.
  - `  VIEW  ` is the name of the view that you want to create.

Examples:

Enter the following command to create a view named `  myview  ` in `  mydataset  ` in your default project. The expiration time is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour), the description is set to `  This is my view  ` , and the label is set to `  organization:development  ` . The query used to create the view queries data from the [USA Name Data public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=usa_names&page=dataset) .

``` text
bq mk \
--use_legacy_sql=false \
--expiration 3600 \
--description "This is my view" \
--label organization:development \
--view \
'SELECT
  name,
  number
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
WHERE
  gender = "M"
ORDER BY
  number DESC' \
mydataset.myview
```

Enter the following command to create a view named `  myview  ` in `  mydataset  ` in `  myotherproject  ` . The description is set to `  This is my view  ` , the label is set to `  organization:development  ` , and the view's expiration is set to the dataset's default table expiration. The query used to create the view queries data from the [USA Name Data public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=usa_names&page=dataset) .

``` text
bq mk \
--use_legacy_sql=false \
--description "This is my view" \
--label organization:development \
--project_id myotherproject \
--view \
'SELECT
  name,
  number
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
WHERE
  gender = "M"
ORDER BY
  number DESC' \
mydataset.myview
```

After the view is created, you can update the view's expiration, description, and labels. For more information, see [Updating views](/bigquery/docs/updating-views) .

### Terraform

Use the [`  google_bigquery_table  `](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/bigquery_table) resource.

**Note:** To create BigQuery objects using Terraform, you must enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](/resource-manager/reference/rest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

The following example creates a view named `  myview  ` :

``` terraform
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "default" {
  dataset_id                      = "mydataset"
  default_partition_expiration_ms = 2592000000  # 30 days
  default_table_expiration_ms     = 31536000000 # 365 days
  description                     = "dataset description"
  location                        = "US"
  max_time_travel_hours           = 96 # 4 days

  labels = {
    billing_group = "accounting",
    pii           = "sensitive"
  }
}

resource "google_bigquery_table" "default" {
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.default.dataset_id
  table_id   = "myview"

  view {
    query          = "SELECT global_id, faa_identifier, name, latitude, longitude FROM `bigquery-public-data.faa.us_airports`"
    use_legacy_sql = false
  }

}
```

To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.

## Prepare Cloud Shell

1.  Launch [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) .

2.  Set the default Google Cloud project where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
    
    You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
    
    ``` text
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PROJECT_ID
    ```
    
    Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform configuration file.

## Prepare the directory

Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also called a *root module* ).

1.  In [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) , create a directory and a new file within that directory. The filename must have the `  .tf  ` extension—for example `  main.tf  ` . In this tutorial, the file is referred to as `  main.tf  ` .
    
    ``` text
    mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
    ```

2.  If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
    
    Copy the sample code into the newly created `  main.tf  ` .
    
    Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.

3.  Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.

4.  Save your changes.

5.  Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
    
    ``` text
    terraform init
    ```
    
    Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the `  -upgrade  ` option:
    
    ``` text
    terraform init -upgrade
    ```

## Apply the changes

1.  Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or update match your expectations:
    
    ``` text
    terraform plan
    ```
    
    Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.

2.  Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering `  yes  ` at the prompt:
    
    ``` text
    terraform apply
    ```
    
    Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete\!" message.

3.  [Open your Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to view the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure that Terraform has created or updated them.

**Note:** Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project.

### API

Call the [`  tables.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/tables/insert) method with a [table resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/tables) that contains a `  view  ` property.

### Go

Before trying this sample, follow the Go setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Go API reference documentation](https://godoc.org/cloud.google.com/go/bigquery) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

``` go
import (
 "context"
 "fmt"

 "cloud.google.com/go/bigquery"
)

// createView demonstrates creation of a BigQuery logical view.
func createView(projectID, datasetID, tableID string) error {
 // projectID := "my-project-id"
 // datasetID := "mydatasetid"
 // tableID := "mytableid"
 ctx := context.Background()

 client, err := bigquery.NewClient(ctx, projectID)
 if err != nil {
     return fmt.Errorf("bigquery.NewClient: %v", err)
 }
 defer client.Close()

 meta := &bigquery.TableMetadata{
     // This example shows how to create a view of the shakespeare sample dataset, which
     // provides word frequency information.  This view restricts the results to only contain
     // results for works that contain the "king" in the title, e.g. King Lear, King Henry V, etc.
     ViewQuery: "SELECT word, word_count, corpus, corpus_date FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare` WHERE corpus LIKE '%king%'",
 }
 if err := client.Dataset(datasetID).Table(tableID).Create(ctx, meta); err != nil {
     return err
 }
 return nil
}
```

### Node.js

Before trying this sample, follow the Node.js setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Node.js API reference documentation](https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/bigquery/latest/index.html) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

``` javascript
// Import the Google Cloud client library and create a client
const {BigQuery} = require('@google-cloud/bigquery');
const bigquery = new BigQuery();

async function createView() {
  // Creates a new view named "my_shared_view" in "my_dataset".

  /**
   * TODO(developer): Uncomment the following lines before running the sample.
   */
  // const myDatasetId = "my_table"
  // const myTableId = "my_table"
  // const projectId = "bigquery-public-data";
  // const sourceDatasetId = "usa_names"
  // const sourceTableId = "usa_1910_current";
  const myDataset = await bigquery.dataset(myDatasetId);

  console.log(`View ${view.id} created.`);
}
```

### Python

Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Python API reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

``` python
from google.cloud import bigquery

client = bigquery.Client()

view_id = "my-project.my_dataset.my_view"
source_id = "my-project.my_dataset.my_table"
view = bigquery.Table(view_id)

# The source table in this example is created from a CSV file in Google
# Cloud Storage located at
# `gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/us-states/us-states.csv`. It contains
# 50 US states, while the view returns only those states with names
# starting with the letter 'W'.
view.view_query = f"SELECT name, post_abbr FROM `{source_id}` WHERE name LIKE 'W%'"

# Make an API request to create the view.
view = client.create_table(view)
print(f"Created {view.table_type}: {str(view.reference)}")
```

After you create the view, you [query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries) it like you query a table.
