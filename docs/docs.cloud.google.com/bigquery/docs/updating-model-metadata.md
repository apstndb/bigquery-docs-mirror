# Update model metadata

This page shows you how to update BigQuery ML model metadata. You can update model metadata by:

  - Using the Google Cloud console.
  - Using the `  bq update  ` command in the bq command-line tool.
  - Calling the [`  models.patch  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models/patch) API method directly or by using the client libraries.

The following model metadata can be updated:

  - [**Description**](#description) : Can be updated by using the Google Cloud console, bq command-line tool, API, or client libraries.
  - [**Labels**](#labels) : Can be updated by using the Google Cloud console, bq command-line tool, API, or client libraries.
  - [**Expiration time**](#expiration) : Can be updated by using the bq tool, API, or client libraries.

## Required permissions

To update model metadata, you must be assigned the [`  WRITER  `](/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam#grant_access_to_a_dataset) role on the dataset, or you must be assigned a project-level Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that includes `  bigquery.models.updateMetadata  ` permissions. If you are granted `  bigquery.models.updateMetadata  ` permissions at the project level, you can update metadata for models in any dataset in the project. The following predefined, project-level IAM roles include `  bigquery.models.updateMetadata  ` permissions:

  - `  bigquery.dataEditor  `
  - `  bigquery.dataOwner  `
  - `  bigquery.admin  `

For more information on IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery ML, see [Access control](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

## Update a model's description

A model's description is a text string that is used to identify the model.

To update a model's description:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then click the dataset.

4.  Click the **Models** tab, and then click a model name to select the model.

5.  Click the **Details** tab.

6.  To update the model's description, click **Edit** edit .

7.  In the **Edit detail** dialog, update the description and then click **Save** .

### bq

To update a model's description, issue the `  bq update  ` command with the `  --model  ` or `  -m  ` flag and the `  --description  ` flag.

If you are updating a model in a project other than your default project, add the project ID to the dataset in the following format: `  [PROJECT_ID]:[DATASET]  ` .

``` text
bq update --model --description "[STRING]" PROJECT_ID:DATASET.MODEL
```

Replace the following:

  - `  STRING  ` is the text string that describes your model in quotes.
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` is your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` is the name of the dataset.
  - `  MODEL  ` is the name of the model.

The command output looks like the following:

``` text
Model 'myproject.mydataset.mymodel' successfully updated.
```

You can confirm your changes by issuing the `  bq show  ` command. For more information, see [Get model metadata](/bigquery/docs/getting-model-metadata) .

Examples:

Enter the following command to update the description of `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` in your default project.

``` text
bq update --model --description "My updated description" \
mydataset.mymodel
```

Enter the following command to update the description of `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` in `  myotherproject  ` .

``` text
bq update --model --description "My updated description" \
myotherproject:mydataset.mymodel
```

### API

To update a model's description by using the API, call the [`  models.patch  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models/patch) method and provide the `  projectId  ` , `  datasetId  ` , and `  modelId  ` . To modify the description, add to or update the "description" property for the [model resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models#Model) .

model = client.update_model(model, ["description"])  # Make an API request.

full_model_id = "{}.{}.{}".format(model.project, model.dataset_id, model.model_id)
print(
    "Updated model '{}' with description '{}'.".format(
        full_model_id, model.description
    )
)
```

## Update a model's labels

Labels are key-value pairs that you can attach to a resource. When you create BigQuery ML resources, labels are optional. For more information, see [Adding and using labels](/bigquery/docs/adding-using-labels) .

To update a model's labels:

### Console

1.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then click the dataset.

3.  Click the **Models** tab, and then click a model name to select the model.

4.  Click the **Details** tab.

5.  To update the model's labels, click **Edit** edit .

6.  In the **Edit detail** dialog, add, delete, or modify labels, and then click **Save** .

### bq

To update a model's labels, issue the `  bq update  ` command with the `  --model  ` or `  -m  ` flag and the `  --set_label  ` flag. Repeat the `  --set_label  ` flag to add or update multiple labels.

If you are updating a model in a project other than your default project, add the project ID to the dataset in the following format: `  [PROJECT_ID]:[DATASET]  ` .

``` text
bq update --model --set_label KEY:VALUE \
PROJECT_ID:DATASET.MODEL
```

Replace the following:

  - `  KEY:VALUE  ` corresponds to a key:value pair for a label that you want to add or update. If you specify the same key as an existing label, the value for the existing label is updated. The key must be unique.
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` is your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` is the name of the dataset.
  - `  MODEL  ` is the name of the model.

The command output looks like the following.

``` text
Model 'myproject.mydataset.mymodel' successfully updated.
```

You can confirm your changes by issuing the `  bq show  ` command. For more information, see [Get model metadata](/bigquery/docs/getting-model-metadata) .

Examples:

To update the `  department  ` label on `  mymodel  ` , enter the `  bq update  ` command and specify `  department  ` as the label key. For example, to update the `  department:shipping  ` label to `  department:logistics  ` , enter the following command. `  mydataset  ` is in `  myotherproject  ` , not your default project.

``` text
bq update --model --set_label department:logistics \
myotherproject:mydataset.mymodel
```

### API

To update a model's labels by using the API, call the [`  models.patch  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models/patch) method and provide the `  projectId  ` , `  datasetId  ` , and `  modelId  ` . To modify the labels, add to or update the "labels" property for the [model resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models#Model) .

## Update a model's expiration time

A model's expiration time is a timestamp value that dictates when a model is deleted. You can set a model's expiration time when the model is created by using the CLI, the API, or the client libraries. You can also set or update the expiration time on a model after it is created. A model's expiration time is often referred to as "time to live" or TTL.

If you don't set an expiration time on a model, the model never expires and you must [delete](/bigquery/docs/deleting-models) the model manually.

**Note:** Setting or updating the expiration time on a model is not supported by the Google Cloud console.

The value for the expiration time is expressed differently depending on where the value is set. Use the method that gives you the appropriate level of granularity:

  - In the command-line tool, expiration is expressed in seconds from the current UTC time. When you specify the expiration on the command line, the integer value in seconds is added to the current UTC timestamp.
  - In the API, expiration is expressed in milliseconds since the epoch. If you specify an expiration value that is less than the current timestamp, the model expires immediately.

To update the expiration time for a model:

### Console

Setting or updating the expiration time on a model is not supported by the Google Cloud console.

### bq

To update a model's expiration time, issue the `  bq update  ` command with the `  --model  ` or `  -m  ` flag and the `  --expiration  ` flag.

If you are updating a model in a project other than your default project, add the project ID to the dataset in the following format: `  [PROJECT_ID]:[DATASET]  ` .

``` text
bq update --model --expiration INTEGER \
PROJECT_ID:DATASET.MODEL
```

Replace the following:

  - `  INTEGER  ` is the lifetime (in seconds) for the model. The minimum value is 3600 seconds (one hour). The expiration time evaluates to the current UTC time plus the integer value.
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` is your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` is the name of the dataset.
  - `  MODEL  ` is the name of the model.

The command output looks like the following.

``` text
Model 'myproject.mydataset.mymodel' successfully updated.
```

You can confirm your changes by issuing the `  bq show  ` command. For more information, see [Get model metadata](/bigquery/docs/getting-model-metadata) .

Examples:

Enter the following command to update the expiration time of `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` to 5 days (432000 seconds). `  mydataset  ` is in your default project.

``` text
bq update --model --expiration 432000 mydataset.mymodel
```

Enter the following command to update the expiration time of `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` to 5 days (432000 seconds). `  mydataset  ` is in `  myotherproject  ` , not your default project.

``` text
bq update --model --expiration 432000 myotherproject:mydataset.mymodel
```

### API

To update a model's expiration by using the API, call the [`  models.patch  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models/patch) method and provide the `  projectId  ` , `  datasetId  ` , and `  modelId  ` . To modify the expiration, add to or update the "expirationTime" property for the [model resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models#Model) . "expirationTime" is expressed in milliseconds since the epoch.
