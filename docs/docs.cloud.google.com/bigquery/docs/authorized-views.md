# Authorized views

This document describes how to create authorized views and authorized materialized views in BigQuery.

## Overview

As a data administrator, you can create an *authorized view* to share a subset of data in a dataset to specific users and groups (principals). Principals can view the data you share and run queries on it, but they can't access the source dataset directly.

### View types

A logical view is the default view type for BigQuery, and a materialized view is a precomputed view that periodically caches the results of a query for increased performance and efficiency.

An authorized view for a logical view is called an authorized view, but an authorized view for a materialized view is called an *authorized materialized view* .

If a logical view relies on [a large or computationally expensive query](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#use_cases) , then you can create a materialized view instead. However, querying only a subset of your data or [using other techniques](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#comparison) can often improve performance without the need to create a materialized view.

For more information, see the following resources:

  - [Introduction to logical views](/bigquery/docs/views-intro)
  - [Introduction to materialized views](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro)

### High-level steps for creating authorized views

To create and share a view, review these high-level steps, which are the same for authorized logical views and authorized materialized views.

**Note:** You can also [share all views in a dataset](#share-all-views) .

  - Create a dataset to contain your source data.
  - Run a query to load data into a destination table in the source dataset.
  - Create a dataset to contain your authorized view.
  - Create an authorized view from a SQL query that restricts the columns that your data analysts can see in the query results.
  - Grant your data analysts permission to run query jobs.
  - Grant your data analysts access to the dataset that contains the authorized view.
  - Grant the authorized view access to the source dataset.

## Alternatives

Although authorized views are flexible and scalable, one of the following methods might better apply to your use case:

  - Set row-level policies on a table.
  - Set column-level policies on a table.
  - Store data in a separate table.
  - Share all views in a dataset (authorized datasets).

### Use row-level or column-level security, or separate tables

By setting row-level access policies on a table, or by creating a separate table to hold sensitive data, a data administrator can restrict a user's ability to view that data. Storing data in a separate table isolates the data and removes the ability to see how many rows exist in the table.

In addition, by creating and applying policy tags, a data administrator can restrict the user's ability to view columns in a table.

Storing data in a separate table is the most secure but least flexible method. Setting row-level policies is flexible and secure, while sharing authorized views is flexible and provides the best performance.

To compare these methods in detail, see the following resources:

  - [Comparison of authorized views, row-level security, and separate tables](/bigquery/docs/row-level-security-intro#comparison_of_authorized_views_row-level_security_and_separate_tables)
  - [Introduction to row-level security](/bigquery/docs/row-level-security-intro)
  - [Example use cases for row-level security](/bigquery/docs/row-level-security-intro#example_use_cases)
  - [Introduction to column-level access control](/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro)

### Share all views in a dataset

If you want to give a collection of views access to a dataset without having to authorize each individual view, you can group the views together into a dataset, and then give the dataset that contains the views access to the dataset that contains the data.

You can then give principals access to the dataset containing the group of views, or to individual views in the dataset, as needed. A dataset that has access to another dataset is called an *authorized dataset* . The dataset that authorizes another dataset to access its data is called the *shared dataset* .

A dataset's access control list can have up to 2,500 total authorized resources, including [authorized views](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views) , [authorized datasets](/bigquery/docs/authorized-datasets) , and [authorized functions](/bigquery/docs/authorized-functions) . If you exceed this limit due to a large number of authorized views, consider grouping the views into authorized datasets. As a best practice, group related views into authorized datasets when you design new BigQuery architectures, especially multi-tenant architectures.

For more information, see [Authorized datasets](/bigquery/docs/authorized-datasets) and [Authorize a dataset](/bigquery/docs/authorized-datasets#authorize_a_dataset) .

## Limitations

  - When you make an authorized view or authorized materialized view in another dataset, the source data dataset and authorized view dataset must be in the same regional [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) .
  - When you delete an authorized view, it can take up to 24 hours to remove the authorized view from the list of views. During this time, you cannot access the authorized view, but the deleted authorized view can appear in the list of views, and counts against the [authorized view limit](/bigquery/quotas#dataset_limits) . This limit can prevent the creation of additional authorized views if the new authorized view would exceed that limit.

## Before you begin

[Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles](#required_permissions) that give users the necessary permissions to query the authorized views or authorized materialized views that you share.

### Required roles

To create or update an authorized view, you need permissions to the dataset that contains the view and to the dataset that provides access to the view.

You also need to grant users or groups access to the project and dataset that contain the view.

**Note:** You can't change the SQL query of an authorized view unless you're a data owner.

#### Admin permissions on the dataset that contains the view

Views are treated as table resources in BigQuery, so creating a view requires the same permissions as creating a table. You must also have permissions to query any tables that are referenced by the view's SQL query.

To create a view, you need the `  bigquery.tables.create  ` IAM permission. The `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` predefined IAM role includes the permissions that you need to create a view.

Additionally, if you have the `  bigquery.datasets.create  ` permission, you can create views in the datasets that you create. To create a view for data that you don't own, you must have `  bigquery.tables.getData  ` permission for that table.

For more information on IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

#### Admin permissions on the second dataset that gives access to the view

To update dataset properties, you need the following IAM permissions:

  - `  bigquery.datasets.update  `
  - `  bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy  ` (only required when updating dataset access controls in the Google Cloud console)

The `  roles/bigquery.dataOwner  ` predefined IAM role includes the permissions that you need to update dataset properties.

Additionally, if you have the `  bigquery.datasets.create  ` permission, you can update properties of the datasets that you create.

For more information on IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/access-control) .

#### User permissions on the project and dataset for the view

To share an authorized view with users or groups, you must grant the users or groups the following IAM permissions:

  - The `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` IAM role to the project that contains the authorized view. This role grants the `  bigquery.jobs.create  ` permission which is required to run query jobs against the view.
  - The `  roles/bigquery.dataViewer  ` IAM role to the dataset that contains the authorized view. This role grants the `  bigquery.tables.getData  ` which is required to query the view.

## Work with authorized views

The following sections describe how to work with authorized views and authorized materialized views.

### Create an authorized view

To create an authorized view, choose one of the following options. For complete steps to authorize, share, and delete an authorized view, see the tutorial [Create an authorized view](/bigquery/docs/create-authorized-views) .

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, type the query that you want to base the authorized view on.

3.  Click **Save** \> **Save view** .

4.  In the **Save view** dialog, do the following:
    
    1.  For **Project** , type the project in which to save the view.
    
    2.  For **Dataset** , type the dataset in which to save the view. This must be a different dataset than the dataset used in the source query.
    
    3.  For **Table** , type the name of the view.
    
    4.  Click **Save** .

5.  Grant [necessary permissions](#user_permissions_on_the_project_and_dataset_for_the_view) to users who can use the authorized view.

6.  In the **Explorer** pane, select the dataset used in the source query.

7.  In the **Details** pane, click **Sharing** \> **Authorize views** .

8.  In the **Authorized views** pane, for **Authorized view** , type the fully qualified name of the view, in the format PROJECT\_ID . DATASET\_ID . VIEW\_NAME .

9.  Click **Add authorization** .

### Terraform

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

**Note:** To create BigQuery objects using Terraform, you must enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](/resource-manager/reference/rest) .

``` terraform
# Creates an authorized view.

# Create a dataset to contain the view.
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "view_dataset" {
  dataset_id  = "view_dataset"
  description = "Dataset that contains the view"
  location    = "us-west1"
}

# Create the view to authorize.
resource "google_bigquery_table" "movie_view" {
  project     = google_bigquery_dataset.view_dataset.project
  dataset_id  = google_bigquery_dataset.view_dataset.dataset_id
  table_id    = "movie_view"
  description = "View to authorize"

  view {
    query          = "SELECT item_id, avg(rating) FROM `movie_project.movie_dataset.movie_ratings` GROUP BY item_id ORDER BY item_id;"
    use_legacy_sql = false
  }
}


# Authorize the view to access the dataset
# that the query data originates from.
resource "google_bigquery_dataset_access" "view_authorization" {
  project    = "movie_project"
  dataset_id = "movie_dataset"

  view {
    project_id = google_bigquery_table.movie_view.project
    dataset_id = google_bigquery_table.movie_view.dataset_id
    table_id   = google_bigquery_table.movie_view.table_id
  }
}

# Specify the IAM policy for principals that can access
# the authorized view. These users should already
# have the roles/bigqueryUser role at the project level.
data "google_iam_policy" "principals_policy" {
  binding {
    role = "roles/bigquery.dataViewer"
    members = [
      "group:example-group@example.com",
    ]
  }
}

# Set the IAM policy on the authorized  view.
resource "google_bigquery_table_iam_policy" "authorized_view_policy" {
  project     = google_bigquery_table.movie_view.project
  dataset_id  = google_bigquery_table.movie_view.dataset_id
  table_id    = google_bigquery_table.movie_view.table_id
  policy_data = data.google_iam_policy.principals_policy.policy_data
}
```

To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.

## Prepare Cloud Shell

1.  Launch [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) .

2.  Set the default Google Cloud project where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
    
    You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
    
    ``` text
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PROJECT_ID
    ```
    
    Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform configuration file.

## Prepare the directory

Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also called a *root module* ).

1.  In [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) , create a directory and a new file within that directory. The filename must have the `  .tf  ` extension—for example `  main.tf  ` . In this tutorial, the file is referred to as `  main.tf  ` .
    
    ``` text
    mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
    ```

2.  If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
    
    Copy the sample code into the newly created `  main.tf  ` .
    
    Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.

3.  Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.

4.  Save your changes.

5.  Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
    
    ``` text
    terraform init
    ```
    
    Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the `  -upgrade  ` option:
    
    ``` text
    terraform init -upgrade
    ```

## Apply the changes

1.  Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or update match your expectations:
    
    ``` text
    terraform plan
    ```
    
    Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.

2.  Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering `  yes  ` at the prompt:
    
    ``` text
    terraform apply
    ```
    
    Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete\!" message.

3.  [Open your Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to view the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure that Terraform has created or updated them.

**Note:** Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project.

### Manage users or groups for authorized views

After authorizing a view, you can maintain access to it by completing the following tasks for a dataset, table, or view:

  - View the access policy.
  - Grant access.
  - Revoke access.
  - Deny access.

For more information, see [Control access to resources using IAM](/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam) .

### Remove authorization to a view

**Note:** If you remove a view, wait 24 hours before reusing the view name, or use a unique name. For more information, see [Quotas and limits](#quotas_and_limits) .

To remove authorization to a view, select one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then select a dataset.

4.  Click **Overview \> Tables** , and then select a table.

5.  Click person\_add **Sharing** \> **Authorize views** .

6.  Click delete to **Remove authorization** .

7.  Click **Close** .

### bq

To remove authorization from a view, use the `  bq rm  ` command. Enter the `  table_id  ` for the view you want to remove authorization from.

``` text
    bq rm \
    project_id:dataset:table_id
    
```

### API

Call the [`  tables.delete  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/delete) method and use the `  projectID  ` , `  datasetID  ` , and `  tableID  ` properties to remove the authorized view for your dataset. For more information, see [Tables](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables) .

## Quotas and limits

  - Authorized views are subject to dataset limits. For more information, see [Dataset limits](/bigquery/quotas#dataset_limits) .
  - If you remove an authorized view, it can take up to 24 hours for all references to the view to be removed from the system. To avoid errors, either wait 24 hours before reusing the name of a removed view, or create a unique name for your view.

## Advanced topics

The following sections describe advanced methods of using authorized views.

### Combine row-level security with authorized views

The data displayed in a logical view or a materialized view is filtered according to the underlying source table's row-level access policies.

For details about how row-level security interacts with materialized views, see [Use row-level security with other BigQuery features](/bigquery/docs/using-row-level-security-with-features#logical_materialized_and_authorized_views) .

### Combine column-level security with authorized views

The impact of column-level security on views is independent of whether or not the view is an authorized view.

For a detailed description of how permissions are applied, see [Query views](/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro#views) for column-level security.

### Use BigQuery sharing with authorized views

BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub) is a data exchange platform with the following capabilities:

  - Lets you share data and insights at scale across organizational boundaries.
  - Uses a robust security and privacy framework.
  - Supports publishing a BigQuery dataset, called a *shared dataset* , and its associated authorized views and authorized datasets, to a set of subscribers.

A *linked dataset* is a read-only BigQuery dataset that serves as a pointer or reference to a shared dataset. Subscribing to a Sharing *listing* creates a linked dataset in your project but not a copy of the dataset, so subscribers can read the data but cannot add or update objects within it.

Materialized views that refer to tables in the linked dataset are [not supported](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction#limitations) .

For more information, see [Introduction to Sharing](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction) .
