# Introduction to Blob Storage transfers

The BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Azure Blob Storage lets you automatically schedule and manage recurring load jobs from Azure Blob Storage and [Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-introduction) into BigQuery.

## Supported file formats

The BigQuery Data Transfer Service supports loading data from Blob Storage in the following formats:

  - Comma-separated values (CSV)
  - JSON (newline delimited)
  - Avro
  - Parquet
  - ORC

## Supported compression types

The BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Blob Storage supports loading compressed data. The compression types supported by the BigQuery Data Transfer Service are the same as the compression types supported by BigQuery load jobs. For more information, see [Loading compressed and uncompressed data](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#loading_compressed_and_uncompressed_data) .

## Transfer prerequisites

To load data from a Blob Storage data source, first gather the following:

  - The Blob Storage account name, container name, and data path (optional) for your source data. The data path field is optional; it's used to match common object prefixes and file extensions. If the data path is omitted, all files in the container are transferred.
  - An Azure shared access signature (SAS) token that grants read access to your data source. For details on creating a SAS token, see [Shared access signature (SAS)](#shared-access-signature) .

## Transfer runtime parameterization

The Blob Storage data path and the destination table can both be parameterized, letting you load data from containers organized by date. The parameters used by Blob Storage transfers are the same as those used by Cloud Storage transfers. For details, see [Runtime parameters in transfers](/bigquery/docs/blob-storage-transfer-parameters) .

## Data ingestion for Azure Blob transfers

You can specify how data is loaded into BigQuery by selecting a **Write Preference** in the transfer configuration when you [set up an Azure Blob transfer](/bigquery/docs/blob-storage-transfer#set_up_an_azure_blob_storage_data_transfer) .

There are two types of write preferences available, [incremental transfers](#incremental_transfers) and [truncated transfers](#truncated_transfers) .

### Incremental transfers

A transfer configuration with an **`  APPEND  `** or **`  WRITE_APPEND  `** write preference, also called an incremental transfer, incrementally appends new data since the previous successful transfer to a BigQuery destination table. When a transfer configuration runs with an **`  APPEND  `** write preference, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service filters for files which have been modified since the previous successful transfer run. To determine when a file is modified, BigQuery Data Transfer Service looks at the file metadata for a "last modified time" property. For example, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service looks at the [`  updated  ` timestamp property](/storage/docs/metadata#timestamps) in a Cloud Storage file. If the BigQuery Data Transfer Service finds any files with a "last modified time" that have occurred after the timestamp of the last successful transfer, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service transfers those files in an incremental transfer.

To demonstrate how incremental transfers work, consider the following Cloud Storage transfer example. A user creates a file in a Cloud Storage bucket at time 2023-07-01T00:00Z named `  file_1  ` . The [`  updated  ` timestamp](/storage/docs/metadata#timestamps) for `  file_1  ` is the time that the file was created. The user then creates an incremental transfer from the Cloud Storage bucket, scheduled to run once daily at time 03:00Z, starting from 2023-07-01T03:00Z.

  - At 2023-07-01T03:00Z, the first transfer run starts. As this is the first transfer run for this configuration, BigQuery Data Transfer Service attempts to load all files matching the source URI into the destination BigQuery table. The transfer run succeeds and BigQuery Data Transfer Service successfully loads `  file_1  ` into the destination BigQuery table.
  - The next transfer run, at 2023-07-02T03:00Z, detects no files where the `  updated  ` timestamp property is greater than the last successful transfer run (2023-07-01T03:00Z). The transfer run succeeds without loading any additional data into the destination BigQuery table.

The preceding example shows how the BigQuery Data Transfer Service looks at the `  updated  ` timestamp property of the source file to determine if any changes were made to the source files, and to transfer those changes if any were detected.

Following the same example, suppose that the user then creates another file in the Cloud Storage bucket at time 2023-07-03T00:00Z, named `  file_2  ` . The [`  updated  ` timestamp](/storage/docs/metadata#timestamps) for `  file_2  ` is the time that the file was created.

  - The next transfer run, at 2023-07-03T03:00Z, detects that `  file_2  ` has an `  updated  ` timestamp greater than the last successful transfer run (2023-07-01T03:00Z). Suppose that when the transfer run starts it fails due to a transient error. In this scenario, `  file_2  ` is not loaded into the destination BigQuery table. The last successful transfer run timestamp remains at 2023-07-01T03:00Z.
  - The next transfer run, at 2023-07-04T03:00Z, detects that `  file_2  ` has an `  updated  ` timestamp greater than the last successful transfer run (2023-07-01T03:00Z). This time, the transfer run completes without issue, so it successfully loads `  file_2  ` into the destination BigQuery table.
  - The next transfer run, at 2023-07-05T03:00Z, detects no files where the `  updated  ` timestamp is greater than the last successful transfer run (2023-07-04T03:00Z). The transfer run succeeds without loading any additional data into the destination BigQuery table.

The preceding example shows that when a transfer fails, no files are transferred to the BigQuery destination table. Any file changes are transferred at the next successful transfer run. Any subsequent successful transfers following a failed transfer does not cause duplicate data. In the case of a failed transfer, you can also choose to [manually trigger a transfer](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) outside its regularly scheduled time.

**Warning:** BigQuery Data Transfer Service relies on the "last modified time" property in each source file to determine which files to transfer, as seen in the incremental transfer examples. Modifying these properties can cause the transfer to skip certain files, or load the same file multiple times. This property can have different names in each storage system supported by BigQuery Data Transfer Service. For example, Cloud Storage objects call this property [`  updated  `](/storage/docs/metadata#timestamps) .

### Truncated transfers

A transfer configuration with a **`  MIRROR  `** or **`  WRITE_TRUNCATE  `** write preference, also called a truncated transfer, overwrites data in the BigQuery destination table during each transfer run with data from all files matching the source URI. **`  MIRROR  `** overwrites a fresh copy of data in the destination table. If the destination table is using a partition decorator, the transfer run only overwrites data in the specified partition. A destination table with a partition decorator has the format `  my_table${run_date}  ` —for example, `  my_table$20230809  ` .

Repeating the same incremental or truncated transfers in a day does not cause duplicate data. However, if you run multiple different transfer configurations that affect the same BigQuery destination table, this can cause the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to duplicate data.

## Wildcard support for the Blob Storage data path

You can select source data that is separated into multiple files by specifying one or more asterisk ( `  *  ` ) wildcard characters in the data path.

While more than one wildcard can be used in the data path, some optimization is possible when only a single wildcard is used:

  - There is a [higher limit](#quotas_and_limits) on the maximum number of files per transfer run.
  - The wildcard will span directory boundaries. For example, the data path `  my-folder/*.csv  ` will match the file `  my-folder/my-subfolder/my-file.csv  ` .

## Blob Storage data path examples

The following are examples of valid data paths for a Blob Storage transfer. Note that data paths do not begin with `  /  ` .

### Example: Single file

To load a single file from Blob Storage into BigQuery, specify the Blob Storage filename:

``` text
my-folder/my-file.csv
```

### Example: All files

To load all files from a Blob Storage container into BigQuery, set the data path to a single wildcard:

``` text
*
```

### Example: Files with a common prefix

To load all files from Blob Storage that share a common prefix, specify the common prefix with or without a wildcard:

``` text
my-folder/
```

or

``` text
my-folder/*
```

### Example: Files with a similar path

To load all files from Blob Storage with a similar path, specify the common prefix and suffix:

``` text
my-folder/*.csv
```

When you only use a single wildcard, it spans directories. In this example, every CSV file in `  my-folder  ` is selected, as well as every CSV file in every subfolder of `  my-folder  ` .

### Example: Wildcard at end of path

Consider the following data path:

``` text
logs/*
```

All of the following files are selected:

``` text
logs/logs.csv
logs/system/logs.csv
logs/some-application/system_logs.log
logs/logs_2019_12_12.csv
```

### Example: Wildcard at beginning of path

Consider the following data path:

``` text
*logs.csv
```

All of the following files are selected:

``` text
logs.csv
system/logs.csv
some-application/logs.csv
```

And none of the following files are selected:

``` text
metadata.csv
system/users.csv
some-application/output.csv
```

### Example: Multiple wildcards

By using multiple wildcards, you gain more control over file selection, at the cost of [lower limits](#quotas_and_limits) . When you use multiple wildcards, each individual wildcard only spans a single subdirectory.

Consider the following data path:

``` text
*/*.csv
```

Both of the following files are selected:

``` text
my-folder1/my-file1.csv
my-other-folder2/my-file2.csv
```

And neither of the following files are selected:

``` text
my-folder1/my-subfolder/my-file3.csv
my-other-folder2/my-subfolder/my-file4.csv
```

## Shared access signature (SAS)

The Azure SAS token is used to access Blob Storage data on your behalf. Use the following steps to create a SAS token for your transfer:

1.  Create or use an existing Blob Storage user to access the storage account for your Blob Storage container.

2.  Create a SAS token at the **storage account** level. To create a SAS token using Azure Portal, do the following:
    
    1.  For **Allowed services** , select **Blob** .
    2.  For **Allowed resource types** , select both **Container** and **Object** .
    3.  For **Allowed permissions** , select **Read** and **List** .
    4.  The default expiration time for SAS tokens is 8 hours. Set an expiration time that works for your transfer schedule.
    5.  Do not specify any IP addresses in the **Allowed IP addresses** field.
    6.  For **Allowed protocols** , select **HTTPS only** .

3.  After the SAS token is created, note the **SAS token** value that is returned. You need this value when you configure transfers.

## IP restrictions

If you restrict access to your Azure resources using an Azure Storage firewall, you must add the IP ranges used by BigQuery Data Transfer Service workers to your list of allowed IPs.

To add IP ranges as allowed IPs to Azure Storage firewalls, see [IP restrictions](/storage-transfer/docs/source-microsoft-azure#ip_restrictions) .

## Consistency considerations

It should take approximately 5 minutes for a file to become available to the BigQuery Data Transfer Service after it is added to the Blob Storage container.

**Important:** To reduce the possibility of missing data, schedule your Blob Storage transfers to occur at least 5 minutes after your files are added to the container.

## Best practices for controlling egress costs

Transfers from Blob Storage could fail if the destination table is not configured properly. Possible causes of an improper configuration include the following:

  - The destination table does not exist.
  - The table schema is not defined.
  - The table schema is not compatible with the data being transferred.

To avoid extra Blob Storage egress costs, first test a transfer with a small but representative subset of files. Ensure that this test is small in both data size and file count.

It's also important to note that prefix matching for data paths happens before files are transferred from Blob Storage, but wildcard matching happens within Google Cloud. This distinction could increase Blob Storage egress costs for files that are transferred to Google Cloud but not loaded into BigQuery.

As an example, consider this data path:

``` text
folder/*/subfolder/*.csv
```

Both of the following files are transferred to Google Cloud, because they have the prefix `  folder/  ` :

``` text
folder/any/subfolder/file1.csv
folder/file2.csv
```

However, only the `  folder/any/subfolder/file1.csv  ` file is loaded into BigQuery, because it matches the full data path.

## Quotas and limits

The BigQuery Data Transfer Service uses load jobs to load Blob Storage data into BigQuery. All BigQuery [quotas and limits](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#load_jobs) on load jobs apply to recurring Blob Storage transfers, with the following additional considerations:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Limit</th>
<th>Default</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Maximum size per load job transfer run</td>
<td>15 TB</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Maximum number of files per transfer run when the Blob Storage data path includes 0 or 1 wildcards</td>
<td>10,000,000 files</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Maximum number of files per transfer run when the Blob Storage data path includes 2 or more wildcards</td>
<td>10,000 files</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
