# Table functions

A table function, also called a table-valued function (TVF), is a user-defined function that returns a table. You can use a table function anywhere that you can use a table. Table functions behave similarly to views, but a table function can take parameters.

## Create table functions

To create a table function, use the [`  CREATE TABLE FUNCTION  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_table_function_statement) statement. A table function contains a query that produces a table. The function returns the query result. The following table function takes an `  INT64  ` parameter and uses this value inside a `  WHERE  ` clause in a query over a [public dataset](/bigquery/public-data) called `  bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current  ` :

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset.names_by_year(y INT64)
AS (
  SELECT year, name, SUM(number) AS total
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
  WHERE year = y
  GROUP BY year, name
);
```

To filter in other ways, you can pass multiple parameters to a table function. The following table function filters the data by year and name prefix:

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset.names_by_year_and_prefix(
  y INT64, z STRING)
AS (
  SELECT year, name, SUM(number) AS total
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_current`
  WHERE
    year = y
    AND STARTS_WITH(name, z)
  GROUP BY year, name
);
```

You can set TVF parameters to be tables. Following the table parameter name, you must specify the required table schema explicitly, the same way that you specify the fields of a struct. The table argument that you pass to the TVF can contain additional columns besides those specified in the parameter schema, and the columns can appear in any order.

The following table function returns a table that contains total sales for `  item_name  ` from the `  orders  ` table:

``` text
CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset.compute_sales (
  orders TABLE<sales INT64, item STRING>, item_name STRING)
AS (
  SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_sales, item
  FROM orders
  WHERE item = item_name
  GROUP BY item
);
```

### Parameter names

If a table function parameter matches the name of a table column, it can create an ambiguous reference. In that case, BigQuery interprets the name as a reference to the table column, not the parameter. The recommended practice is to use parameter names that are distinct from the names of any referenced table columns.

## Use table functions

You can call a table function in any context where a table is valid. The following example calls the `  mydataset.names_by_year  ` function in the `  FROM  ` clause of a `  SELECT  ` statement:

``` text
SELECT * FROM mydataset.names_by_year(1950)
  ORDER BY total DESC
  LIMIT 5
```

The results look like the following:

``` text
+------+--------+-------+
| year |  name  | total |
+------+--------+-------+
| 1950 | James  | 86447 |
| 1950 | Robert | 83717 |
| 1950 | Linda  | 80498 |
| 1950 | John   | 79561 |
| 1950 | Mary   | 65546 |
+------+--------+-------+
```

You can join the output from a table function with another table:

``` text
SELECT *
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare` AS s
  JOIN mydataset.names_by_year(1950) AS n
  ON n.name = s.word
```

You can also use a table function in a [subquery](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries#array_subquery_concepts) :

``` text
SELECT ARRAY(
  SELECT name FROM mydataset.names_by_year(1950)
  ORDER BY total DESC
  LIMIT 5)
```

When you call a table function that has a table parameter, you must use the `  TABLE  ` keyword before the name of the table argument. The table argument can have columns not listed in the table parameter schema:

``` text
CREATE TABLE FUNCTION mydataset.compute_sales (
  orders TABLE<sales INT64, item STRING>, item_name STRING)
AS (
  SELECT SUM(sales) AS total_sales, item
  FROM orders
  WHERE item = item_name
  GROUP BY item
);

WITH my_orders AS (
    SELECT 1 AS sales, "apple" AS item, 0.99 AS price
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, "banana", 0.49
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 5, "apple", 0.99)
SELECT *
FROM mydataset.compute_sales(TABLE my_orders, "apple");

/*-------------+-------+
 | total_sales | item  |
 +-------------+-------+
 | 6           | apple |
 +-------------+-------*/
```

## List table functions

Table functions are a type of routine. To list all of the routines in a dataset, see [List routines](/bigquery/docs/routines#list_routines) .

## Delete table functions

To delete a table function, use the [`  DROP TABLE FUNCTION  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#drop_table_function) statement:

``` text
DROP TABLE FUNCTION mydataset.names_by_year
```

## Authorize routines

You can authorize table functions as *routines* . Authorized routines let you share query results with specific users or groups without giving them access to the underlying tables that generated the results. For example, an authorized routine can compute an aggregation over data or look up a table value and use that value in a computation. For more information, see [Authorized routines](/bigquery/docs/authorized-routines) .

## Limitations

  - The query body must be a `  SELECT  ` statement and cannot modify anything. For example, data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements are not allowed in table functions. If you need side-effects, consider writing a [procedure](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_procedure) instead.

  - Table functions must be stored in the same location as the tables they reference.

## Quotas

For more information about table function quotas and limits, see [Quotas and limits](/bigquery/quotas#table_function_limits) .
