# Create notebooks

This document describes how to create [Colab Enterprise notebooks in BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/notebooks-introduction) . Notebooks are [BigQuery Studio](/bigquery/docs/query-overview#bigquery-studio) code assets powered by [Dataform](/dataform/docs/overview) .

## Before you begin

1.  Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads.

2.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
    
    **Roles required to select or create a project**
    
      - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
      - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

3.  [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

4.  Enable the BigQuery API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

5.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
    
    **Roles required to select or create a project**
    
      - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
      - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

6.  [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

7.  Enable the BigQuery API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

### Required permissions

Set the appropriate permissions to create, edit, or view notebooks.

All users with the [Dataform Admin role](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.admin) ( `  roles/dataform.admin  ` ) have owner access to all notebooks created in the project.

For more information about BigQuery Identity and Access Management (IAM), see [Access control with IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

#### Permissions to create notebooks

To get the permissions that you need to create and run notebooks, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles:

  - [BigQuery Read Session User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.readSessionUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.readSessionUser  ` )

  - [BigQuery Studio User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.studioUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.studioUser  ` )
    
    The BigQuery Studio User role combines the following IAM roles:
    
      - [BigQuery Job User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` )
      - [Notebook Runtime User](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser) ( `  roles/aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser  ` )
      - [Code Creator](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeCreator) ( `  roles/dataform.codeCreator  ` )

**Warning:** Visibility for code assets is governed by project-level Dataform permissions. Users with the `  dataform.repositories.list  ` permission—which is included in standard BigQuery roles such as [BigQuery Job User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) , [BigQuery Studio User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.studioUser) , and [BigQuery User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.user) —can see all code assets in the **Explorer** panel of the Google Cloud project, regardless of whether they created these assets or these assets were shared with them. To restrict visibility, you can create [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) that exclude the `  dataform.repositories.list  ` permission.

**Note:** Users assigned the Code Creator role in a project can list the names of code assets in that project by using the Dataform API or the Dataform command-line interface (CLI).

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) . To see the exact permissions that are required to create and run notebooks, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

  - `  bigquery.config.get  `
  - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `
  - `  bigquery.readsessions.create  `
  - `  bigquery.readsessions.getData  `
  - `  bigquery.readsessions.update  `
  - `  resourcemanager.projects.get  `
  - `  resourcemanager.projects.list  `
  - `  dataform.locations.get  `
  - `  dataform.locations.list  `
  - `  dataform.repositories.create  `
  - `  dataform.repositories.list  `
  - `  dataform.collections.create  `
  - `  dataform.collections.list  `
  - `  aiplatform.notebookRuntimeTemplates.apply  `
  - `  aiplatform.notebookRuntimeTemplates.get  `
  - `  aiplatform.notebookRuntimeTemplates.list  `
  - `  aiplatform.notebookRuntimeTemplates.getIamPolicy  `
  - `  aiplatform.notebookRuntimes.assign  `
  - `  aiplatform.notebookRuntimes.get  `
  - `  aiplatform.notebookRuntimes.list  `
  - `  aiplatform.operations.list  `

**Note:** When you create a notebook, BigQuery grants you the [Dataform Admin role](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.admin) ( `  roles/dataform.admin  ` ) on that notebook. All users with the Dataform Admin role granted on the Google Cloud project have owner access to all the notebooks created in the project. To override this behavior, see [Grant a specific role upon resource creation](/dataform/docs/access-control#grant-specific-role) .

#### Roles to edit notebooks

To edit and run notebooks, you need the following IAM roles:

  - [BigQuery Job User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` )
  - [BigQuery Read Session User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.readSessionUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.readSessionUser  ` )
  - [Notebook Runtime User](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser) ( `  roles/aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser  ` )
  - [Code Editor](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeEditor) ( `  roles/dataform.codeEditor  ` )

#### Roles to view notebooks

To view and run notebooks, you need the following IAM roles:

  - [BigQuery Job User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` )
  - [BigQuery Read Session User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.readSessionUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.readSessionUser  ` )
  - [Notebook Runtime User](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser) ( `  roles/aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser  ` )
  - [Code Viewer](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeViewer) ( `  roles/dataform.codeViewer  ` )

## Create notebooks

Use the following sections to learn how to create a notebook.

### Set the default region for code assets

If this is the first time you are creating a code asset, you should set the default region for code assets. You can't change the region for a code asset after it is created.

**Note:** If you create a notebook and choose a different default region than the one you have been using for code assets—for example, choosing `  us-west1  ` when you have been using `  us-central1  ` —then that notebook and all code assets you create afterwards use that new region by default. Existing code assets continue to use the region they were assigned when they were created.

All code assets in BigQuery Studio use the same default region. To set the default region for code assets, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, find the project in which you have enabled code assets.

3.  Click more\_vert **View actions** next to the project, and then click **Change my default code region** .

4.  For **Region** , select the region that you want to use for code assets.

5.  Click **Select** .

For a list of supported regions, see [BigQuery Studio locations](/bigquery/docs/locations#bqstudio-loc) .

### Create a notebook using the notebook gallery

4.  Alternatively, you can click the arrow\_drop\_down arrow next to add\_box **SQL query** , and then click **Notebook \> Empty notebook** , **Notebook \> BigQuery template** , or **Notebook \> Spark template** to open these specific templates.

5.  To create a runnable notebook from the template, click **Use this template** .

6.  Optional: To view notebook details or the [version history](#create_a_notebook_from_an_existing_notebook) , add new comments, or reply to or get a link to an existing comment, use the following toolbar:
    
    The **Comments** toolbar feature is in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) . To provide feedback or request support for this feature, send an email to <bqui-workspace-pod@google.com> .

7.  Optional: In the toolbar, you can use the **Reference** panel to preview the schema details of tables, snapshots, views, or materialized views, or open them in a new tab. The panel also has a list of recent and starred resources.

### Create a notebook from a table

To create a notebook containing a default query for a specific table, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then click your dataset.

4.  Click **Overview \> Tables** , and find the table that you want to query.

5.  Next to the table, click more\_vert **Actions** , and then click **Open in \> Python notebook** .
    
    The new notebook opens, containing cells that show example queries against the selected table.

### Create a notebook to explore the result set of a query

6.  In the **Region** field, select the region where you want to upload your notebook.

7.  Click **Upload** .

Your notebook can be accessed through the **Explorer** pane.

## Connect to a runtime

Use the following sections to learn how to connect a notebook to a [Vertex AI runtime](/colab/docs/create-runtime) . A runtime is a compute resource that runs the code in your notebook. The runtime must be in the same region as your notebook.

For more information about runtimes, see [Runtimes and runtime templates](/colab/docs/runtimes) .

**Note:** If you use [VPC Service Controls](/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview) , make sure you have configured [Private Google Access with VPC Service Controls](/vpc-service-controls/docs/private-connectivity) before connecting to a runtime. Otherwise, the service returns the error `  Failed to connect to Runtime Network projects/ projectid /global/networks/default' was not found.  `

### Connect to the default runtime

The default runtime is a preset runtime that requires minimal setup.

To connect to the default runtime, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Notebooks** .

4.  Click the name of a notebook to open it.

5.  In the notebook, click **Connect** , or run any cell in the notebook.
    
    It might take several minutes to connect to the default runtime if you don't already have an active runtime.

### Connect to a non-default runtime

If you want to use a runtime other than the default runtime, you must first [create that additional runtime in Vertex AI](/vertex-ai/docs/colab/create-runtime) .

To connect to non-default runtime, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Notebooks** .

4.  Click the name of a notebook to open it.

5.  In the notebook, click the arrow\_drop\_down drop-down next to **Connect** and then click **Connect to a runtime** .

6.  Click **Connect to an existing runtime** .

7.  In **Runtimes** , select the runtime to use. The runtime must be in the same location as the notebook.

8.  Click **Connect** .

### Connect to a new runtime

To connect to a new runtime, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Notebooks** .

4.  Click the name of a notebook to open it.

5.  In the notebook, click the arrow\_drop\_down drop-down next to **Connect** and then click **Connect to a runtime** .

6.  Click **Create new runtime** .

7.  In **Runtime Template** , select the [Vertex AI runtime template](/colab/docs/create-runtime-template) to use.

8.  In **Runtime name** , type a name for the runtime.

9.  Click **Connect** .

## Understand cells

A notebook is made up of cells that you can edit. The following types of cells are supported:

  - **Text cell** : Use a text cell to add explanations and images to your notebook in Markdown.

  - **Code cell** : Use a code cell to add Python to your notebook. You can run each code cell individually. A code cell can reference any variables created in another cell that you've already run.

  - **SQL cell** ( [Preview](/products#product-launch-stages) ): Use a [SQL cell](/colab/docs/sql-cells) to run GoogleSQL queries. The output of the query is automatically saved as a DataFrame with the same name as the title of the cell. You can run multiple SQL statements in a single SQL cell, but only the results of the last statement are saved to a DataFrame.
    
    You can refer to Python variables in expressions or use BigQuery DataFrames as tables in your query by enclosing the variable name in braces ( `  { }  ` ):
    
    ``` text
    # Refer to the Python variable my_threshold in a SQL expression.
    SELECT * FROM my_dataset.my_table WHERE x > {my_threshold};
    
    # Reference previous query results to iterate on your queries.
    SELECT * FROM {df};
    ```

  - **Visualization cell** ( [Preview](/products#product-launch-stages) ): Use a [visualization cell](/colab/docs/visualization-cells) to automatically generate a visualization of any DataFrame in your notebook. You can modify which columns are displayed and select from various chart types and aggregations. You can also choose custom colors, data labels, and titles.

## Grant access to notebooks

To grant other users access to a notebook, add those users to an appropriate IAM role.

**Important:** Users who have access to the notebook can see all output generated by code in the notebook, even if this output contains data from tables they don't have access to. To prevent saved output from being shared, [disable notebook output saving](/bigquery/docs/create-notebooks#disable_output_saving) .

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Notebooks** .

4.  Find the notebook that you want to grant access to.

5.  Click more\_vert **Open actions** next to the notebook, and then click **Share** .

6.  In the **Share permissions** pane, click **Add user/group** .

7.  In the **New principals** field, enter a principal.

8.  In the **Role** list, select one of the following roles:
    
      - [**Code Owner**](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeOwner) : Can perform any action on the notebook, including deleting or sharing it.
      - [**Code Editor**](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeEditor) : Can edit the notebook.
      - [**Code Viewer**](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeViewer) : Can view the notebook.
    
    **Note:** The principal must also have the [Notebook Runtime User ( `  roles/aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser  ` )](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser) and [BigQuery User ( `  roles/bigquery.user  ` )](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.user) roles to run the notebook.

9.  Optional: To view a complete list of roles and advanced sharing settings, click **Advanced sharing** .

10. Click **Save** .

11. To return to the notebook information page, click **Close** .

## Share notebooks

To share a notebook with other users, you can generate and share a link to the notebook. For other users to see the notebook you share, you must first [grant access](/bigquery/docs/create-notebooks#grant_access_to_notebooks) to the notebook.

To run a notebook, users must have access to the data that the notebook accesses. For more information, see [Grant access to a dataset](/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam#grant_access_to_a_dataset) .

**Important:** Users who have access to the notebook can see all output generated by code in the notebook, even if this output contains data from tables they don't have access to. To prevent saved output from being shared, [disable notebook output saving](/bigquery/docs/create-notebooks#disable_output_saving) .

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Notebooks** .

4.  Find the notebook that you want to share. You can use the search feature or filters to find your notebook.

5.  Click more\_vert **View actions** next to the notebook, and then click **Share** \> **Copy link** .

6.  Share the link with other users.

## Disable notebook output saving

You can prevent sharing saved notebook output with other users who have access to the notebook file by disabling notebook output saving.

When you disable output saving for a selected notebook, BigQuery deletes all output saved in the notebook file and doesn't save the output of subsequent runs.

However, users who have [access to the notebook](/bigquery/docs/create-notebooks#grant_access_to_notebooks) can still view its output in the following ways:

  - Run the notebook to view its current output. This output is not saved.
  - View an archival version of the notebook and its output in revision history.

To disable saving of output for a selected notebook, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Notebooks** .

4.  Click the notebook for which you want to disable saving output.

5.  To expand the menu bar, click keyboard\_arrow\_down **Toggle header visibility** .

6.  Click **Edit \> Notebook settings** .

7.  In the **Notebook settings** window, select **Omit code cell output when saving this notebook** .

8.  Click **Save** .

9.  Click **Reload** .

## Resolve conflicts

If you and another user make conflicting changes in a notebook, the service raises the error `  Automatic saving failed. This file was updated remotely or in another tab.  ` and provides a `  Show diff  ` link. To resolve the conflict, follow these steps:

1.  Click the `  Show diff  ` link. The **Review remote changes** dialog opens.
2.  Optional: To compare the notebook source code, select the **Raw source** checkbox.
3.  Optional: To compare the versions inline instead of in separate panes, select the **Inline diff** checkbox.
4.  Review the changes and decide which to keep, revising your input if necessary.
5.  Click **Save your changes** .

## Rename notebooks

To rename a notebook, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Notebooks** .

4.  Click the notebook that you want to rename.

5.  Click keyboard\_arrow\_down **Toggle header visibility** to expand the menu bar.
