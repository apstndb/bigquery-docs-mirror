# Load Salesforce Marketing Cloud data into BigQuery

You can load data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud to BigQuery using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector. With the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, you can schedule recurring transfer jobs that add your latest data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud to BigQuery.

## Limitations

Salesforce Marketing Cloud data transfers are subject to the following limitations:

  - A single transfer configuration can only support one data transfer run at a given time. In the case where a second data transfer is scheduled to run before the first transfer is completed, then only the first data transfer completes while any other data transfers that overlap with the first transfer is skipped.
      - To avoid skipped transfers within a single transfer configuration, we recommend that you increase the duration of time between large data transfers by configuring the **Repeat frequency** .
  - To use a network attachment with this data transfer, you must first [create a network attachment by defining a static IP address](/bigquery/docs/connections-with-network-attachment) .
  - If your configured network attachment and virtual machine (VM) instance are located in different regions, there might be cross-region data movement when you transfer data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

## Before you begin

The following sections describe the steps that you need to take before you create a Salesforce Marketing Cloud data transfer.

### Salesforce Marketing Cloud prerequisites

You must have the following information when creating a Salesforce Marketing Cloud data transfer:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Parameter Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       subdomain      </code></td>
<td>The API subdomain, found in the base URI. For example, in the authentication base URI <code dir="ltr" translate="no">       https://               SUBDOMAIN              .auth.marketingcloudapis.com/      </code> , SUBDOMAIN is your subdomain value.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       instance      </code></td>
<td>The API server instance, found in the URL after you sign into the Salesforce Marketing Cloud application. The instance value includes `s` followed by a numeric value. For example, in the URL `https://mc.s4.exacttarget.com/`, the instance value is `s4`. For more information, see <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000383566&amp;type=1">Find the stack location for a Marketing Cloud account</a></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       clientId      </code></td>
<td>The client ID from the API integration. Navigate to <strong>Setup</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Installed Packages</strong> , and then click the package name. The client ID is listed under <strong>Components</strong> .</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       clientSecret      </code></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       Salesforce Marketing Cloud objects to transfer      </code></td>
<td>Compile a list of Salesforce Marketing Cloud objects to include in this transfer. You can select objects when you <a href="#sfmc-transfer-setup">set up a transfer configuration</a> . For a list of supported objects, see <a href="#supported-tables">Supported tables</a> .</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Setup IP allow list for Salesforce Marketing Cloud transfers

You must configure your Google Cloud environment and your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account to add specific IP addresses to the allowlist for data transfers. This ensures that Salesforce Marketing Cloud only accepts connections from a trusted, static IP address.

To do so, you must first set up and configure your Google Cloud network to use a static IP address:

1.  [Set up a public network address translation (NAT)](/nat/docs/set-up-manage-network-address-translation) with a static IP address within your Virtual Private Cloud network. The CloudNAT must be configured within the same region as the destination dataset for this data transfer.
2.  [Set up a network attachment](/vpc/docs/create-manage-network-attachments) within the same VPC network. This resource is used by the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to access private services.

Next, you must [add the static IP address to the allowlist in Salesforce Marketing Cloud](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=mktg.mc_overview_allowlist_ip.htm&language=en_US&type=5) . When adding the range of the IP address, use the static IP address from your Google Cloud public NAT for both the beginning and ending IP addresses for the IP range.

Once you have set up the IP ranges, you can now specify the static IP when you [set up your transfer configuration](/bigquery/docs/sfmc-transfer#sfmc-transfer-setup) by selecting your network attachment in the **Network attachment** field.

#### Data extension object requirements

To include data extension objects in your data transfer, the object must meet the following requirements:

  - The name of the data extension object must include the `  DataExtensionObject  ` prefix followed by the object name. For example, `  DataExtensionObject_ DATA_EXTENSION_NAME  ` .
  - You must enable the `  Read  ` scope for the data extension object.
  - The file locations of the data extension object must have the `  Read  ` and `  Write  ` scopes.

### Install and configure Salesforce Marketing Cloud API integration package

You must install a server-to-server API integration package in Salesforce Marketing Cloud. You can do so in Salesforce Marketing Cloud by installing a new installed package, and specifying the component **API Integration** \> **Server-to-Server** . For more information, see [Create and Install Packages](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/install-packages.html) .

Once you've installed the API integration package, you must add the following permissions scopes:

  - Access: `  Offline Access  `
  - Email: `  Read  `
  - OTT: `  Read  `
  - Push: `  Read  `
  - SMS: `  Read  `
  - Web: `  Read  `
  - Documents and images: `  Read  `
  - Saved Content: `  Read  `
  - Journeys: `  Read  `
  - Audiences: `  Read  `
  - List and Subscribers: `  Read  `
  - Date Extensions: `  Read  `
  - File Locations `  Read  `
  - Tracking Events: `  Read  `
  - Callbacks: `  Read  `
  - Subscriptions: `  Read  `
  - Campaign: `  Read  `
  - Assets: `  Read  `
  - Accounts: `  Read  `
  - OTT Channels: `  Read  `
  - Users: `  Read  `

For more information, see [API Integration Permission Scopes](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/guide/data-access-permissions.html) .

### BigQuery prerequisites

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store your data.
  - If you intend to set up transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, ensure that you have the `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission. Pub/Sub permissions are not required if you only set up email notifications. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer:

  - BigQuery Data Transfer Service permissions:
      - `  bigquery.transfers.update  `
      - `  bigquery.transfers.get  `
  - BigQuery permissions:
      - `  bigquery.datasets.get  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.update  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information, see [Grant `  bigquery.admin  ` access](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service#grant_bigqueryadmin_access) .

## Set up a Salesforce Marketing Cloud data transfer

Add Salesforce Marketing Cloud data into BigQuery by setting up a transfer configuration using one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the Data transfers page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  Click add **Create transfer** .

3.  In the **Source type** section, for **Source** , select **Salesforce Marketing Cloud** .

4.  In the **Data source details** section, do the following:
    
      - For **Network attachment** , select a network attachment from the menu. Before you can use a network attachment with this data transfer, you must [create a network attachment by defining a static IP address](/bigquery/docs/connections-with-network-attachment) .
      - For **API Subdomain** , enter the [subdomain of your authentication base URI](/bigquery/docs/sfmc-transfer#sfmc-prereqs) .
      - For **API instance** , enter the [API instance from the URL](/bigquery/docs/sfmc-transfer#sfmc-prereqs) after you sign in to the Marketing Cloud application.
      - For **Client ID** , enter the [client ID from your API integration package](/bigquery/docs/sfmc-transfer#sfmc-prereqs) .
      - For **Client Secret** , enter the [client secret from your API integration package](/bigquery/docs/sfmc-transfer#sfmc-prereqs) .

5.  In the **Destination settings** section, for **Dataset** , select the dataset that you created to store your data.

6.  In the **Transfer config name** section, for **Display name** , enter a name for the data transfer.

7.  In the **Schedule options** section, do the following:
    
      - In the **Repeat frequency** list, select an option to specify how often this data transfer runs. To specify a custom repeat frequency, select **Custom** . If you select **On-demand** , then this transfer runs when you [manually trigger the transfer](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .
      - If applicable, select either **Start now** or **Start at set time** , and provide a start date and run time.

8.  Optional: In the **Notification options** section, do the following:
    
      - To enable email notifications, click the **Email notification** toggle. When you enable this option, the transfer administrator receives an email notification when a transfer run fails.
      - To enable [Pub/Sub transfer run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) for this transfer, click the **Pub/Sub notifications** toggle. You can select your [topic](/pubsub/docs/overview#types) name, or you can click **Create a topic** to create one.

9.  Click **Save** .

### bq

Enter the [`  bq mk  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#mk-transfer-config) and supply the transfer creation flag — `  --transfer_config  ` .

``` text
bq mk
    --transfer_config
    --project_id=PROJECT_ID
    --data_source=DATA_SOURCE
    --display_name=DISPLAY_NAME
    --target_dataset=DATASET
    --params='PARAMETERS'
```

Replace the following:

  - PROJECT\_ID (optional): your Google Cloud project ID. If `  --project_id  ` isn't supplied to specify a particular project, the default project is used.
  - DATA\_SOURCE : the data source (for example, `  saphana  ` ).
  - DISPLAY\_NAME : the display name for the transfer configuration. The data transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.
  - DATASET : the target dataset for the transfer configuration.
  - PARAMETERS : the parameters for the created transfer configuration in JSON format. For example: `  --params='{"param":"param_value"}'  ` . The following are the parameters for a Salesforce Marketing Cloud transfer:
      - `  connector.subdomain  ` : The API subdomain.
      - `  connector.instance  ` : The API instance value.
      - `  connector.authentication.oauth.clientId  ` : The app ID name for the OAuth client.
      - `  connector.authentication.oauth.clientSecret  ` : The app secret for the OAuth client.
      - `  assets  ` : a list of the names of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud tables to be transferred from Salesforce Marketing Cloud as part of the transfer.

For example, the following command creates a Salesforce Marketing Cloud data transfer in the default project with all the required parameters:

``` text
  bq mk
      --transfer_config
      --target_dataset=mydataset
      --data_source=salesforce_marketing
      --display_name='My Transfer'
      --params='{"connector.subdomain": "abcd",
      "connector.instance": "x",
      "connector.authentication.oauth.clientId": "1234567890",
      "connector.authentication.oauth.clientSecret":"ABC12345"}'
```

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.transferConfigs.create  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create) and supply an instance of the [`  TransferConfig  ` resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs#TransferConfig) .

When you save the transfer configuration, the Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector automatically triggers a transfer run according to your schedule option.

### Supported tables

With every transfer run, the Salesforce Marketing Cloud connector transfers all available data from Salesforce Marketing Cloud into BigQuery into the following tables based on the REST interface:

  - `  Assets  `
  - `  CampaignAssets  `
  - `  Campaigns  `
  - `  Categories  `
  - `  EventDefinitions  `
  - `  FacebookMessengerProperties  `
  - `  JourneyActivities  `
  - `  Journeys  `
  - `  LineMessengerProperties  `
  - `  SendDefinitions  `
  - `  Subscriptions  `
  - `  DataExtension  `
  - `  DataExtensionObject_ DATA_EXTENSION_NAME  `
  - `  Email  `
  - `  LinkSend  `
  - `  List  `
  - `  ListSubscriber  `
  - `  Subscriber  `
  - `  TriggeredSendDefinition  `

To manually run a data transfer outside of your regular schedule, you can start a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .
