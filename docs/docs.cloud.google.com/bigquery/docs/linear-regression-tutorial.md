In this tutorial, you use a [linear regression model](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-glm) in BigQuery ML to predict the weight of a penguin based on the penguin's demographic information. A linear regression is a type of regression model that generates a continuous value from a linear combination of input features.

This tutorial uses the [`  bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins  `](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=ml_datasets&t=penguins&page=table) dataset.

## Objectives

In this tutorial, you will perform the following tasks:

  - Create a linear regression model.
  - Evaluate the model.
  - Make predictions by using the model.

**Note:** This tutorial covers linear regression in pure SQL. For a linear regression tutorial using Python and BigQuery DataFrames on the same dataset, see [Create a regression model with BigQuery DataFrames](/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-dataframes-regression-model) .

## Costs

This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud, including the following:

  - BigQuery
  - BigQuery ML

For more information on BigQuery costs, see the [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) page.

For more information on BigQuery ML costs, see [BigQuery ML pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#bqml) .

## Before you begin

1.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
    
    **Roles required to select or create a project**
    
      - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
      - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

2.  [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

3.  Enable the BigQuery API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

## Required permissions

To create the model using BigQuery ML, you need the following IAM permissions:

  - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `
  - `  bigquery.models.create  `
  - `  bigquery.models.getData  `
  - `  bigquery.models.updateData  `
  - `  bigquery.models.updateMetadata  `

To run inference, you need the following permissions:

  - `  bigquery.models.getData  ` on the model
  - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

## Create a dataset

Create a BigQuery dataset to store your ML model.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, click your project name.

3.  Click more\_vert **View actions \> Create dataset**

4.  On the **Create dataset** page, do the following:
    
      - For **Dataset ID** , enter `  bqml_tutorial  ` .
    
      - For **Location type** , select **Multi-region** , and then select **US (multiple regions in United States)** .
    
      - Leave the remaining default settings as they are, and click **Create dataset** .

### bq

To create a new dataset, use the [`  bq mk  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#mk-dataset) command with the `  --location  ` flag. For a full list of possible parameters, see the [`  bq mk --dataset  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#mk-dataset) reference.

1.  Create a dataset named `  bqml_tutorial  ` with the data location set to `  US  ` and a description of `  BigQuery ML tutorial dataset  ` :
    
    ``` text
    bq --location=US mk -d \
     --description "BigQuery ML tutorial dataset." \
     bqml_tutorial
    ```
    
    Instead of using the `  --dataset  ` flag, the command uses the `  -d  ` shortcut. If you omit `  -d  ` and `  --dataset  ` , the command defaults to creating a dataset.

2.  Confirm that the dataset was created:
    
    ``` text
    bq ls
    ```

### API

Call the [`  datasets.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/datasets/insert) method with a defined [dataset resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/datasets) .

``` text
{
  "datasetReference": {
     "datasetId": "bqml_tutorial"
  }
}
```

### BigQuery DataFrames

Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using BigQuery DataFrames](/bigquery/docs/dataframes-quickstart) . For more information, see the [BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) .

``` python
import google.cloud.bigquery

bqclient = google.cloud.bigquery.Client()
bqclient.create_dataset("bqml_tutorial", exists_ok=True)
```

## Create the model

Create a linear regression model using the Analytics sample dataset for BigQuery.

### SQL

You can create a linear regression model by using the [`  CREATE MODEL  ` statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-glm) and specifying `  LINEAR_REG  ` for the model type. Creating the model includes training the model.

The following are useful things to know about the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement:

  - The [`  input_label_cols  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-glm#input_label_cols) option specifies which column in the `  SELECT  ` statement to use as the label column. Here, the label column is `  body_mass_g  ` . For linear regression models, the label column must be real-valued, that is, the column values must be real numbers.

  - This query's `  SELECT  ` statement uses the following columns in the `  bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins  ` table to predict a penguin's weight:
    
      - `  species  ` : the species of penguin.
      - `  island  ` : the island that the penguin resides on.
      - `  culmen_length_mm  ` : the length of the penguin's culmen in millimeters.
      - `  culmen_depth_mm  ` : the depth of the penguin's culmen in millimeters.
      - `  flipper_length_mm  ` : the length of the penguin's flippers in millimeters.
      - `  sex  ` : the sex of the penguin.

  - The `  WHERE  ` clause in this query's `  SELECT  ` statement, `  WHERE body_mass_g IS NOT NULL  ` , excludes rows where the `  body_mass_g  ` column is `  NULL  ` .

Run the query that creates your linear regression model:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, run the following query:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model`
    OPTIONS
      (model_type='linear_reg',
      input_label_cols=['body_mass_g']) AS
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
    WHERE
      body_mass_g IS NOT NULL;
    ```

3.  It takes about 30 seconds to create the `  penguins_model  ` model.
    
    To see the model, follow these steps:
    
    1.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
        
        If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.
    
    2.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Datasets** .
    
    3.  Click the `  bqml_tutorial  ` dataset.
    
    4.  Click the **Models** tab.

### BigQuery DataFrames

Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using BigQuery DataFrames](/bigquery/docs/dataframes-quickstart) . For more information, see the [BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) .

``` python
from bigframes.ml.linear_model import LinearRegression
import bigframes.pandas as bpd

# Load data from BigQuery
bq_df = bpd.read_gbq("bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins")

# Drop rows with nulls to get training data
training_data = bq_df.dropna(subset=["body_mass_g"])

# Specify your feature (or input) columns and the label (or output) column:
feature_columns = training_data.drop(columns=["body_mass_g"])
label_columns = training_data[["body_mass_g"]]

# Create the linear model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(feature_columns, label_columns)
model.to_gbq(
    your_model_id,  # For example: "bqml_tutorial.penguins_model"
    replace=True,
)
```

It takes about 30 seconds to create the model. To see the model, follow these steps:

1.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Datasets** .

3.  Click the `  bqml_tutorial  ` dataset.

4.  Click the **Models** tab.

## Get training statistics

To see the results of the model training, you can use the [`  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-train) , or you can view the statistics in the Google Cloud console. In this tutorial, you use the Google Cloud console.

A machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and attempting to find a model that minimizes loss. This process is called empirical risk minimization.

Loss is the penalty for a bad prediction. It is a number indicating how bad the model's prediction was on a single example. If the model's prediction is perfect, the loss is zero; otherwise, the loss is greater. The goal of training a model is to find a set of weights and biases that have low loss, on average, across all examples.

See the model training statistics that were generated when you ran the `  CREATE MODEL  ` query:

1.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Datasets** .

3.  Click the `  bqml_tutorial  ` dataset.

4.  Click the **Models** tab.

5.  To open the model information pane, click **penguins\_model** .

6.  Click the **Training** tab, and then click **Table** . The results should look similar to the following:
    
    The **Training Data Loss** column represents the loss metric calculated after the model is trained on the training dataset. Since you performed a linear regression, this column shows the [mean squared error](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#MSE) value. A [normal\_equation](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-glm#optimize_strategy) optimization strategy is automatically used for this training, so only one iteration is required to converge to the final model. For more information on setting the model optimization strategy, see [`  optimize_strategy  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-glm#optimize_strategy) .

## Evaluate the model

After creating the model, evaluate the model's performance by using the [`  ML.EVALUATE  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-evaluate) or the [`  score  ` BigQuery DataFrames function](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest/bigframes.ml.linear_model.LogisticRegression#bigframes_ml_linear_model_LogisticRegression_score) to evaluate the predicted values generated by the model against the actual data.

### SQL

For input, the `  ML.EVALUATE  ` function takes the trained model and a dataset that matches the schema of the data that you used to train the model. In a production environment, you should evaluate the model on different data than the data you used to train the model. If you run `  ML.EVALUATE  ` without providing input data, the function retrieves the evaluation metrics calculated during training. These metrics are calculated by using the automatically reserved evaluation dataset:

``` text
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      ML.EVALUATE(MODEL bqml_tutorial.penguins_model);
    
```

Run the `  ML.EVALUATE  ` query:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, run the following query:
    
    ``` text
      SELECT
        *
      FROM
        ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model`,
          (
          SELECT
            *
          FROM
            `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
          WHERE
            body_mass_g IS NOT NULL));
      
    ```

### BigQuery DataFrames

Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using BigQuery DataFrames](/bigquery/docs/dataframes-quickstart) . For more information, see the [BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) .

``` python
import bigframes.pandas as bpd

# Select the model you will be evaluating. `read_gbq_model` loads model data from
# BigQuery, but you could also use the `model` object from the previous steps.
model = bpd.read_gbq_model(
    your_model_id,  # For example: "bqml_tutorial.penguins_model"
)

# Score the model with input data defined in an earlier step to compare
# model predictions on feature_columns to true labels in label_columns.
score = model.score(feature_columns, label_columns)
# Expected output results:
# index  mean_absolute_error  mean_squared_error  mean_squared_log_error  median_absolute_error  r2_score  explained_variance
#   0        227.012237         81838.159892            0.00507                173.080816        0.872377    0.872377
#   1 rows x 6 columns
```

The results should look similar to the following:

Because you performed a linear regression, the results include the following columns:

  - `  mean_absolute_error  `
  - `  mean_squared_error  `
  - `  mean_squared_log_error  `
  - `  median_absolute_error  `
  - `  r2_score  `
  - `  explained_variance  `

An important metric in the evaluation results is the [R <sup>2</sup> score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination) . The R <sup>2</sup> score is a statistical measure that determines if the linear regression predictions approximate the actual data. A value of `  0  ` indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around the mean. A value of `  1  ` indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around the mean.

You can also look at the model's information pane in the Google Cloud console to view the evaluation metrics:

## Use the model to predict outcomes

Now that you have evaluated your model, the next step is to use it to predict an outcome. You can run the [`  ML.PREDICT  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-predict) or the [`  predict  ` BigQuery DataFrames function](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest/bigframes.ml.linear_model.LogisticRegression#bigframes_ml_linear_model_LogisticRegression_predict) on the model to predict the body mass in grams of all penguins that reside on the Biscoe Islands.

### SQL

For input, the `  ML.PREDICT  ` function takes the trained model and a dataset that matches the schema of the data that you used to train the model, excluding the label column.

Run the `  ML.PREDICT  ` query:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, run the following query:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    ML.PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model`,
      (
      SELECT
        *
      FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
      WHERE island = 'Biscoe'));
    ```

### BigQuery DataFrames

Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using BigQuery DataFrames](/bigquery/docs/dataframes-quickstart) . For more information, see the [BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) .

``` python
# Select the model you'll use for predictions. `read_gbq_model` loads
# model data from BigQuery, but you could also use the `model` object
# object from previous steps.
model = bpd.read_gbq_model(
    your_model_id,
    # For example: "bqml_tutorial.penguins_model",
)

# Load data from BigQuery
bq_df = bpd.read_gbq("bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins")

# Use 'contains' function to filter by island containing the string
# "Biscoe".
biscoe_data = bq_df.loc[bq_df["island"].str.contains("Biscoe")]

result = model.predict(biscoe_data)

# Expected output results:
#     predicted_body_mass_g           species                   island   culmen_length_mm  culmen_depth_mm   body_mass_g    flipper_length_mm   sex

```

The results should look similar to the following:

## Explain the prediction results

### SQL

To understand why the model is generating these prediction results, you can use the [`  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-explain-predict) .

`  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` is an extended version of the `  ML.PREDICT  ` function. `  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` not only outputs prediction results, but also outputs additional columns to explain the prediction results. In practice, you can run `  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` instead of `  ML.PREDICT  ` . For more information, see [BigQuery ML explainable AI overview](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-xai-overview#explainable_ai_offerings_in_bigquery_ml) .

Run the `  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` query:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

<!-- end list -->

1.  In the query editor, run the following query:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model`,
    (
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
    WHERE island = 'Biscoe'),
    STRUCT(3 as top_k_features));
```

1.  The results should look similar to the following:

**Note:** The `  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` query outputs all the input feature columns, similar to what `  ML.PREDICT  ` does. For readability purposes, only one feature column, `  species  ` , is shown in the preceding figure.

### BigQuery DataFrames

Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using BigQuery DataFrames](/bigquery/docs/dataframes-quickstart) . For more information, see the [BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest) .

```

For linear regression models, Shapley values are used to generate feature attribution values for each feature in the model. The output includes the top three feature attributions per row of the `  penguins  ` table because `  top_k_features  ` was set to `  3  ` . These attributions are sorted by the absolute value of the attribution in descending order. In all examples, the feature `  sex  ` contributed the most to the overall prediction.

## Globally explain the model

### SQL

To know which features are generally the most important to determine penguin weight, you can use the [`  ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-global-explain) . In order to use `  ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN  ` , you must retrain the model with the `  ENABLE_GLOBAL_EXPLAIN  ` option set to `  TRUE  ` .

Retrain and get global explanations for the model:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

<!-- end list -->

1.  In the query editor, run the following query to retrain the model:
    
    ``` text
    #standardSQL
    CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model`
    OPTIONS (
      model_type = 'linear_reg',
      input_label_cols = ['body_mass_g'],
      enable_global_explain = TRUE)
    AS
    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
    WHERE
    body_mass_g IS NOT NULL;
    ```

2.  In the query editor, run the following query to get global explanations:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
    *
    FROM
    ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN(MODEL `bqml_tutorial.penguins_model`)
    ```

Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using BigQuery DataFrames](/bigquery/docs/dataframes-quickstart) . For more information, see the [BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) .

``` python
# To use the `global_explain()` function, the model must be recreated with `enable_global_explain` set to `True`.
model = LinearRegression(enable_global_explain=True)

# The model must the be fitted before it can be saved to BigQuery and then explained.
training_data = bq_df.dropna(subset=["body_mass_g"])
X = training_data.drop(columns=["body_mass_g"])
y = training_data[["body_mass_g"]]
model.fit(X, y)
model.to_gbq("bqml_tutorial.penguins_model", replace=True)

# Explain the model
explain_model = model.global_explain()

# Expected results:

## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and delete the individual resources.

  - You can delete the project you created.
  - Or you can keep the project and delete the dataset.

### Delete your dataset

Deleting your project removes all datasets and all tables in the project. If you prefer to reuse the project, you can delete the dataset you created in this tutorial:

1.  If necessary, open the BigQuery page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  In the navigation, click the **bqml\_tutorial** dataset you created.

3.  Click **Delete dataset** on the right side of the window. This action deletes the dataset, the table, and all the data.

4.  In the **Delete dataset** dialog box, confirm the delete command by typing the name of your dataset ( `  bqml_tutorial  ` ) and then click **Delete** .

### Delete your project

To delete the project:

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `  appspot.com  ` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
