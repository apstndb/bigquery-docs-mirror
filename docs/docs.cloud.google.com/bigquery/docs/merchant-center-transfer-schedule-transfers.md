**Preview**

This product is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) . Pre-GA products are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

**Note:** To get support or provide feedback for Merchant Center transfers with BigQuery Data Transfer Service, contact <gmc-transfer-preview@google.com> .

## Before you begin

Before you create a Merchant Center data transfer:

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store the Merchant Center data.
      - For dataset region, we support using the default option, Multi-region, in either US or EU.
      - If you want to create a dataset in a specific region, the Merchant Center data transfer is only supported in the following regions:
      - `  us-east4 (Northern Virginia)  ` ,
      - `  asia-northeast1 (Tokyo)  ` ,
      - `  asia-southeast1 (Singapore)  ` ,
      - `  australia-southeast1 (Sydney)  ` ,
      - `  europe-north1 (Finland)  ` ,
      - `  europe-west2 (London)  ` ,
      - `  europe-west6 (Zurich)  ` .
  - If you intend to setup transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, you must have `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` permissions. Pub/Sub permissions are not required if you just set up email notifications. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service Run Notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

## Required permissions

Ensure that you have granted the following permissions.

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer:

  - BigQuery Data Transfer Service permissions:
      - `  bigquery.transfers.update  `
      - `  bigquery.transfers.get  `
  - BigQuery permissions:
      - `  bigquery.datasets.get  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.update  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information, see [Grant `  bigquery.admin  ` access](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service#grant_bigqueryadmin_access) .

### Required Merchant Center roles

  - [Standard access](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/1637190) to the Merchant Center account that is used in the transfer configuration. If you set up a transfer using a service account, the [service account must have access](https://developers.google.com/merchant/api/guides/authorization/access-your-account#give-service-account-access-account) to the Merchant Center account. You can verify access by clicking the **Users** section in the [Merchant Center UI](https://merchants.google.com/) .

  - To access price competitiveness, price insights, and best sellers data, you must meet the [eligibility requirements for market insights](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/9712881) .

## Set up a Merchant Center transfer

Setting up a data transfer for Merchant Center reporting requires the following:

  - **Merchant ID** or **Multi-client account ID** : This is the Merchant ID shown in the [Merchant Center UI](https://merchants.google.com/mc) .

To create a data transfer for Merchant Center reporting:

### Console

1.  Go to the Data transfers page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  Click add **Create transfer** .

3.  On the **Create Transfer** page:
    
      - In the **Source type** section, for **Source** , choose **Google Merchant Center** .
    
      - In the **Transfer config name** section, for **Display name** , enter a name for the data transfer such as `  My Transfer  ` . The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.
    
      - In the **Schedule options** section:
        
          - Select a **Repeat frequency** . If you select **Hours** , **Days** , **Weeks** , or **Months** , you must also specify a frequency. You can also select **Custom** to specify a custom repeat frequency. If you select **On-demand** , then this data transfer runs when you [manually trigger the transfer](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .
          - If applicable, select either **Start now** or **Start at set time** , and provide a start date and run time.
          - For **Start date and run time** , enter the date and time to start the transfer. This value should be at least 24 hours later than the current UTC time. If you chose **Start now** , this option is disabled.
        
        If you leave the schedule options set to **Start now** , the first data transfer run starts immediately, and it fails with the following error message: `  No data to transfer found for the Merchant account. If you have just created this transfer, you may need to wait for up to a day before the data of your Merchant account are prepared and available for the transfer.  ` The next scheduled run should run successfully. If the data of your Merchant account are prepared on the same date in UTC time, you can [set up a backfill](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) for today's run.
    
      - In the **Destination settings** section, for **Destination dataset** , choose the dataset that you created to store your data.
    
      - In the **Data source details** section, for **Merchant ID** , enter your Merchant ID or MCA ID. Select the report(s) that you would like to transfer. See [Supported Reports](/bigquery/docs/merchant-center-transfer#supported_reports) for more details.
    
      - In the **Service Account** menu, select a [service account](/iam/docs/service-account-overview) from the service accounts associated with yourGoogle Cloud project. You can associate a service account with your data transfer instead of using your user credentials. For more information about using service accounts with data transfers, see [Use service accounts](/bigquery/docs/use-service-accounts) .
        
          - If you signed in with a [federated identity](/iam/docs/workforce-identity-federation) , then a service account is required to create a data transfer. If you signed in with a [Google Account](/iam/docs/principals-overview#google-account) , then a service account for the transfer is optional.
          - The service account must have the [required permissions](/bigquery/docs/merchant-center-transfer-schedule-transfers#required_permissions) .
    
      - (Optional) In the **Notification options** section:
        
          - Click the toggle to enable email notifications. When you enable this option, the transfer administrator receives an email notification when a transfer run fails.
          - For **Select a Pub/Sub topic** , choose your [topic](/pubsub/docs/overview#types) name or click **Create a topic** . This option configures Pub/Sub run [notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) for your transfer.

4.  Click **Save** .

### bq

Enter the `  bq mk  ` command and supply the transfer creation flag — `  --transfer_config  ` . The following flags are also required:

  - `  --data_source  `
  - `  --target_dataset  `
  - `  --display_name  `
  - `  --params  `

You can also supply the `  --project_id  ` flag to specify a particular project. If `  --project_id  ` isn't specified, the default project is used.

``` text
bq mk \
--transfer_config \
--project_id=project_id \
--target_dataset=dataset \
--display_name=name \
--params='parameters' \
--data_source=data_source
--service_account_name=service_account_name
```

Where:

  - project\_id is your project ID.
  - dataset is the target dataset for the transfer configuration.
  - name is the display name for the transfer configuration. The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.
  - parameters contains the parameters for the created transfer configuration in JSON format. For example: `  --params='{"param":"param_value"}'  ` .
      - For Merchant Center data transfers, you must supply the `  merchant_id  ` parameter.
      - The `  export_products  ` parameter specifies whether to transfer product and product issues data. This parameter is included by default, even if you don't specify the `  export_products  ` parameter. Google recommends that you include this parameter explicitly and set it to "true".
      - The `  export_regional_inventories  ` parameter specifies whether to transfer regional inventories data.
      - The `  export_local_inventories  ` parameter specifies whether to transfer local inventories data.
      - The `  export_price_competitiveness  ` parameter specifies whether to transfer price competitiveness data.
      - The `  export_price_insights  ` parameter specifies whether to transfer price insights data.
      - The `  export_best_sellers_v2  ` parameter specifies whether to transfer best sellers data.
      - The `  export_performance  ` parameter specifies whether to transfer product performance data.
  - data\_source is the data source — `  merchant_center  ` .
  - service\_account\_name is the service account name used to authenticate your data transfer. The service account should be owned by the same `  project_id  ` used to create the transfer and it should have all of the [required permissions](#required_permissions) .

**Caution:** You cannot configure notifications by using the command-line tool.

For example, the following command creates a Merchant Center data transfer named `  My Transfer  ` using Merchant ID `  1234  ` and target dataset `  mydataset  ` . The data transfer is created in your default project.

``` text
bq mk \
--transfer_config \
--target_dataset=mydataset \
--display_name='My Transfer' \
--params='{"merchant_id":"1234","export_products":"true","export_regional_inventories":"true","export_local_inventories":"true","export_price_benchmarks":"true","export_best_sellers":"true"}' \
--data_source=merchant_center
```

The first time you run the command, you receive a message like the following:

`  [URL omitted] Please copy and paste the above URL into your web browser and follow the instructions to retrieve an authentication code.  `

Follow the instructions in the message and paste the authentication code on the command line.

**Caution:** When you create a Merchant Center data transfer by using the command-line tool, the transfer configuration is set up using the default values for **Schedule** (every 24 hours at creation time). The first transfer run will start immediately, and it will fail with the following error message: \`No data to transfer found for the Merchant account.

If you have just created this data transfer, you may need to wait for up to a day before the data of your Merchant account are prepared and available for the transfer.\` The next scheduled run should run successfully. If the data of your Merchant account are prepared on the same date in UTC time, you can [set up a backfill](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) for today's run.

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.transferConfigs.create  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create) method and supply an instance of the [`  TransferConfig  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs#TransferConfig) resource.
