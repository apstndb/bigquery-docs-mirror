# Use Gemini Cloud Assist

**Preview**

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) . Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

This document describes how to use [Gemini Cloud Assist](/cloud-assist/overview) , a product of the [Gemini for Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini) portfolio, to help you understand and work with your metadata, jobs, and queries in BigQuery. It provides supported use cases and sample prompts that you can use in Gemini Cloud Assist.

## Before you begin

Before you can use Gemini Cloud Assist, your administrator must perform the steps to [Set up Gemini Cloud Assist](/cloud-assist/set-up-gemini) for the project or folder that you're working in.

In order to support questions and requests about your Google Cloud resources, Gemini Cloud Assist needs the appropriate Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for those resources. Gemini Cloud Assist inherits your permissions when you prompt it to query your BigQuery data, so in many cases, the necessary IAM permissions are already granted. For more information, see [IAM requirements for using Gemini Cloud Assist](/cloud-assist/iam-requirements) .

## Use Gemini Cloud Assist

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the Google Cloud toolbar, click spark **Open or close Gemini AI chat** to open Gemini Cloud Assist chat.

3.  In the **Enter a prompt** field, enter your prompt.

4.  Click **Send prompt** .

The following sections provide examples of tasks that you can perform with Gemini Cloud Assist, along with sample prompts.

## Analyze jobs

Learn more about jobs executed in your project, including your personal job history and project job history, to support the following use cases:

  - **Debug long-running queries** . Learn about the current status of a job and reasons it might be taking longer than expected, such as slot contention, a large number of rows scanned, high data volume, and others. In the **Cloud Assist** panel, enter a prompt similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    Why is this job taking so long? JOB_ID
    ```

  - **Analyze the cause of a failed job** . Learn about why a specific query failed. In the **Cloud Assist** panel, enter a prompt similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    Why did JOB_ID fail?
    ```

  - **Find resource-intensive queries** . Learn about your most expensive queries based on the estimated number of bytes processed. In the **Cloud Assist** panel, enter a prompt similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    What are the 3 most expensive queries that I ran in the last 2 days?
    ```

## Discover resources

Search for and learn about datasets and table resources in a single project or across multiple projects. Gemini Cloud Assist uses Dataplex Universal Catalog to search your BigQuery resources. Searches are performed using your permissions. For example, if you don't have permission to view the metadata of a resource, then it won't show up in the results. Supported use cases include the following:

  - **Search for a resource by name** . In the **Cloud Assist** panel, enter a prompt similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    Do I have any datasets named ecommerce?
    ```

  - **Ask about a table's metadata** . You can ask about a table by name, or let Gemini Cloud Assist infer which table you mean based on your chat history or which table is referenced in your active query tab. If you specify a table by name, then you must use the fully qualified name. You can ask about a table's schema or other metadata, such as partitioning and clustering. In the **Cloud Assist** panel, enter a prompt similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    What's the schema for `project_name.dataset_name.table_name`?
    ```

  - **Ask where to find specific information** . In the **Cloud Assist** panel, enter a prompt similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    Where can I find demographics, such as age and location, for new users from the last year?
    ```

## Generate SQL

Generate a SQL query by describing what you want the query to do. For best results, include the name of the table that you want to query. For example, in the **Cloud Assist** panel, enter a prompt similar to the following:

``` text
Generate a SQL query to show me the duration and subscriber type for the ten longest trips.
Use the `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips` table.
```

## Generate Python code

Generate Python code by describing what you want it to do. For example, in the **Cloud Assist** panel, you can enter the following prompt to ask Gemini to query the `  penguins  ` table from a public dataset using the BigQuery magics syntax:

``` text
Generate python code to query the `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
table using bigquery magics
```
