# Share sensitive data with data clean rooms

Data clean rooms provide a security-enhanced environment in which multiple parties can share, join, and analyze their data assets without moving or revealing the underlying data.

BigQuery data clean rooms use the BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub) platform. While standard [BigQuery sharing data exchanges](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-manage-exchanges) let you share data across organizational boundaries at scale, data clean rooms address use cases for sharing sensitive and protected data. Data clean rooms provide additional security controls to protect the underlying data and enforce [analysis rules](/bigquery/docs/analysis-rules) defined by the data owner.

Primary use cases include the following:

  - **Campaign planning and audience insights.** Let two parties (for example, sellers and buyers) mix first-party data and improve data enrichment in a privacy-centric way.
  - **Measurement and attribution.** Match customer and media performance data to better understand the effectiveness of marketing efforts and make more informed business decisions.
  - **Activation.** Combine customer data with data from other parties to enrich customer understanding, which lets you improve segmentation capabilities and media activation.

Data clean rooms also support several use cases beyond the marketing industry:

  - **Retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG).** Optimize marketing and promotional activities by combining point-of-sale data from retailers and marketing data from CPG companies.
  - **Financial services.** Improve fraud detection by combining sensitive data from other financial and government agencies. Build credit risk scoring by aggregating customer data across multiple banks.
  - **Healthcare.** Share data between doctors and pharmaceutical researchers to learn how patients are reacting to treatments.
  - **Supply chain, logistics, and transportation.** Combine data from suppliers and marketers to get a complete picture of how products perform throughout their lifecycle.

## Roles

There are three main roles in BigQuery data clean rooms:

  - **Data clean room owner** : manages permissions, visibility, and membership of one or more data clean rooms within a Google Cloud project. The data clean room owner can assign the data contributor and data clean room subscriber roles to users. This role is analogous to the [Analytics Hub Admin](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-admin-role) IAM role.
  - **Data contributor** : publishes data to a data clean room. In many cases, a data clean room owner is also a data contributor. This role is analogous to the [Analytics Hub Publisher](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-publisher-role) IAM role.
  - **Data clean room subscriber** : subscribes to the data published in a data clean room and runs queries on the data. This role is analogous to a combination of the [Analytics Hub Subscriber](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-subscriber-role) and [Analytics Hub Subscription Owner](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/analyticshub#analyticshub.subscriptionOwner) IAM roles.

## Architecture

BigQuery data clean rooms use a publish and subscribe model of BigQuery data. BigQuery architecture separates compute and storage, which lets data contributors share data without making multiple copies of the data. The following diagram shows the BigQuery data clean room architecture:

#### Data clean room

A data clean room is an environment for sharing sensitive data that helps prevent raw access and enforces query restrictions. Only users or groups added as data clean room subscribers can subscribe to the shared data. Data clean room owners can create any number of data clean rooms in BigQuery sharing.

#### Shared resources

A shared resource is the unit of data sharing in a data clean room. The resource must be a BigQuery table, view, or routine (table-valued function). As a data contributor, you create or use an existing BigQuery resource in your project to share with your data clean room subscribers.

#### Listings

A data contributor creates a listing when they add data to a data clean room. It contains a reference to the data contributor's shared resource along with descriptive information that helps subscribers use the data. As a data contributor, you can create a listing and include information such as a description, sample queries, and links to documentation for your subscribers.

#### Linked datasets

A linked dataset is a read-only BigQuery dataset that serves as a symbolic link to all data in a data clean room. When data clean room subscribers query resources in a linked dataset, data from the shared resources is returned, satisfying analysis rules set by the data contributor. As a subscriber, a linked dataset is created inside your project when you subscribe to a data clean room. No copy of the data is created, and subscribers can't see certain metadata, such as view definitions.

#### Analysis rules

As a data contributor, you configure analysis rules on the resources that you share in the data clean room. [Analysis rules](/bigquery/docs/analysis-rules) prevent raw access to underlying data and enforce query restrictions. For example, data clean rooms support the [aggregation threshold analysis rule](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#agg_threshold_clause) , which lets data clean room subscribers analyze data only through aggregation queries.

#### Data egress controls

[Data egress](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction#data_egress) controls automatically prevent data clean room subscribers from copying and exporting raw data from a data clean room. Data contributors can configure additional controls to prevent copying and exporting query results that subscribers obtain.

#### Query templates

[Query templates](/bigquery/docs/query-templates) [(Preview)](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) let data clean room owners and BigQuery sharing publishers share predefined queries without sharing the underlying resources of tables and views.

Predefined queries use [table-valued functions (TVFs)](/bigquery/docs/table-functions) in BigQuery that allow an entire table or specific fields to pass as input parameters and return a table as the output.

**Warning:** Allowing data clean room subscribers to run arbitrary queries in your data clean rooms can create security vulnerabilities. To mitigate these risks and enhance data security, use query templates.

## Limitations

BigQuery data clean rooms have the following limitations:

  - You can set [analysis rules](/bigquery/docs/analysis-rules) only on views, not on tables or materialized views. Because of this limitation, if a data contributor directly shares tables or materialized views, or views without analysis rules, into a data clean room, then data clean room subscribers have raw access to the data in those resources.
  - Because data clean rooms use the BigQuery sharing platform, all [BigQuery sharing limitations](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction#limitations) apply.
  - Data clean rooms are only available in [BigQuery sharing regions](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction#supported-regions) .
  - As a data clean room subscriber, you can't search for shared resources in Dataplex Universal Catalog or Data Catalog.
  - As a data clean room subscriber, you can't query [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` views](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro) on linked datasets.
  - As a data contributor, you can't publish an entire dataset directly to a data clean room.
  - As a data contributor, you can't publish models or routines (outside of query templates) to a data clean room.
  - You can add a maximum of 100 shared resources to a data clean room. If you need to increase this limit, contact <bq-dcr-feedback@google.com> .
  - Listings for multiple regions ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ) aren't supported in data clean rooms.

## Before you begin

Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to give users the necessary permissions to perform each task in this document, enable the Analytics Hub API, and assign the Analytics Hub Admin role to your data clean room owner.

### Required permissions

To get the permissions that you need to use data clean rooms, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Data Editor](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataEditor) ( `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` ) IAM role. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to use data clean rooms. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to use data clean rooms:

  - `  serviceUsage.services.get  `
  - `  serviceUsage.services.list  `
  - `  serviceUsage.services.enable  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information about IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see [Introduction to IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

### Enable the Analytics Hub API

To enable the Analytics Hub API, select one of the following options:

### Console

Go to the **Analytics Hub API** page and enable the API for your Google Cloud project.

### bq

Run the [`  gcloud services enable  ` command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/services/enable) :

``` text
gcloud services enable analyticshub.googleapis.com
```

After you enable the Analytics Hub API, you can access the [Sharing (Analytics Hub) page](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/analytics-hub) .

### Assign the Analytics Hub Admin role

Your data clean room owner, the user who creates the data clean room, must have the [Analytics Hub Admin role](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-admin-role) ( `  roles/analyticshub.admin  ` ). To learn how to grant this role to other users, see [Create BigQuery sharing administrators](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-manage-exchanges#create-exchange-administrator) .

## Data clean room owner workflows

As a data clean room owner, you can do the following:

  - Create a data clean room.
  - Update data clean room properties.
  - Delete a data clean room.
  - Manage data contributors.
  - Manage data clean room subscribers.
  - Share a data clean room.

### Additional data clean room owner permissions

You must have the Analytics Hub Admin role ( `  roles/analyticshub.admin  ` ) on your project to perform data clean room owner tasks. You can also assign this role at the folder or organization level, if applicable.

### Create a data clean room

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click **Create clean room** .

3.  For **Project** , select the project for the data clean room. You must enable the Analytics Hub API for the project.

4.  Specify the location, name, primary contact, icon (optional), and description for the data clean room. You can only list resources in the data clean room that are in the same region as the data clean room.

5.  Optional: To log the [principal identifiers](/iam/docs/principal-identifiers) of all users running jobs and queries on linked datasets, click the **Subscriber Email Logging** toggle. The logged data appears in the `  job_principal_subject  ` field of the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SHARED_DATASET_USAGE  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-shared-dataset-usage) .
    
    **Note:** Once you enable and save email logging, you can't edit this setting. To disable email logging, delete the data clean room and recreate it without clicking the **Subscriber Email Logging** toggle.

6.  Click **Create clean room** .

7.  Optional: In the **Clean Room Permissions** section, add other data clean room owners, data contributors, or data clean room subscribers.

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.dataExchanges.create  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges/create) and set the [sharing environment](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges#sharingenvironmentconfig) to `  dcrExchangeConfig  ` .

The following example shows how to call the `  projects.locations.dataExchanges.create  ` method using the `  curl  ` command:

``` text
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -L -X POST https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/dataExchanges?data_exchange_id=CLEAN_ROOM_ID -d
  '{
    display_name: "CLEAN_ROOM_NAME",
    sharing_environment_config: {dcr_exchange_config: {}}
  }'
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the location of the data clean room
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_ID  ` : your data clean room ID
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_NAME  ` : the display name of your data clean room

In the body of the request, provide the [data exchange details](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges#resource:-dataexchange) .

If the request is successful, the response body contains the details of the data clean room.

If you enable subscriber email logging with the `  logLinkedDatasetQueryUserEmail  ` field, the data exchange response contains `  log_linked_dataset_query_user_email: true  ` . The logged data appears in the `  job_principal_subject  ` field of the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SHARED_DATASET_USAGE  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-shared-dataset-usage) .

### Update a data clean room

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click the display name of the data clean room that you want to update.

3.  In the **Details** tab, click **Edit clean room details** .

4.  Update the data clean room name, primary contact, icon, description, or subscriber email logging setting as needed.
    
    **Note:** Once you enable and save email logging, you cannot edit this setting. To disable email logging, delete the data clean room and recreate it without clicking the **Subscriber Email Logging** toggle.

5.  Click **Save** .

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.dataExchanges.patch  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges/patch) and set the [sharing environment](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges#sharingenvironmentconfig) to `  dcrExchangeConfig  ` .

The following example shows how to call the `  projects.locations.dataExchanges.patch  ` method using the `  curl  ` command:

``` text
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -L -X PATCH https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/dataExchanges/CLEAN_ROOM_ID?updateMask=UPDATEMASK -d
'{
  display_name: "CLEAN_ROOM_NAME",
  sharing_environment_config: {dcr_exchange_config: {}}
}'
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the location of the data clean room
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_ID  ` : your data clean room ID
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_NAME  ` : the display name of your data clean room

Replace `  UPDATEMASK  ` with the list of fields that you want to update. To update multiple values, use a comma-separated list. For example, to update the display name and primary contact for a data exchange, enter `  displayName,primaryContact  ` .

In the body of the request, specify updated values for the following fields:

  - `  displayName  `
  - `  description  `
  - `  primaryContact  `
  - `  documentation  `
  - `  icon  `
  - `  discoveryType  `
  - `  logLinkedDatasetQueryUserEmail  `

For details on these fields, see [Resource: DataExchange](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges#resource:-dataexchange) .

### Delete a data clean room

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  In the row of the data clean room that you want to delete, click more\_vert **More actions \> Delete** .

3.  To confirm, enter `  delete  ` , and then click **Delete** . You can't undo this action.

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.dataExchanges.delete  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges/delete) and set the [sharing environment](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges#sharingenvironmentconfig) to `  dcrExchangeConfig  ` .

The following example shows how to call the `  projects.locations.dataExchanges.delete  ` method using the `  curl  ` command:

``` text
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -L -X DELETE https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/dataExchanges?data_exchange_id=CLEAN_ROOM_ID
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the location of the data clean room
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_ID  ` : your data clean room ID
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_NAME  ` : the display name of your data clean room

When you delete a data clean room, all the listings within it are deleted. However, the shared resources and linked datasets are not deleted. The linked datasets are unlinked from the source datasets, so querying resources in the data clean room starts to fail for data clean room subscribers.

### Manage data contributors

As a data clean room owner, you manage which users can add data to your data clean rooms (your data contributors). To let a user add data to a data clean room, grant them the [Analytics Hub Publisher role](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-publisher-role) ( `  roles/analyticshub.publisher  ` ) on a specific data clean room:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click the display name of the data clean room that you want to grant permissions to.

3.  In the **Details** tab, click **Set permissions** .

4.  Click **Add principal** .

5.  For **New principals** , enter the usernames or emails of the data contributors that you're adding.

6.  For **Select a role** , select **Analytics Hub \> Analytics Hub Publisher** .

7.  Click **Save** .

You can delete and update data contributors at any time by clicking **Set Permissions** .

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.dataExchanges.setIamPolicy  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges/setIamPolicy) .

The following example shows how to call the `  projects.locations.dataExchanges.setIamPolicy  ` method using the `  curl  ` command:

``` text
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -L -X POST https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/dataExchanges/CLEAN_ROOM_ID:setIamPolicy -d
'{
  "policy": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "members": [
          "my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
        ],
        "role": "roles/analyticshub.publisher"
      }
    ]
  }
}'
```

The policy in the request body should conform to the structure of a [Policy](/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy) .

You can grant the Analytics Hub Publisher role ( `  roles/analyticshub.publisher  ` ) for an entire project from the [IAM page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin) , which gives a user permission to add data to any data clean room in a project. However, we don't recommend this action, as it might result in users having overly permissive access.

### Manage data clean room subscribers

As a data clean room owner, you manage which users can subscribe to your data clean rooms (your subscribers). To allow a user to subscribe to a data clean room, grant them the [Analytics Hub Subscriber role](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-subscriber-role) ( `  roles/analyticshub.subscriber  ` ) and [Analytics Hub Subscription Owner role](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-subscription-owner-role) ( `  roles/analyticshub.subscriptionOwner  ` ) on a specific data clean room:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click the display name of the data clean room that you want to grant permissions to.

3.  In the **Details** tab, click **Set permissions** .

4.  Click **Add principal** .

5.  For **New principals** , enter the usernames or emails of the data clean room subscribers that you're adding.

6.  For **Select a role** , select **Analytics Hub \> Analytics Hub Subscriber** .

7.  Click add\_box **Add another role** .

8.  For **Select a role** , select **Analytics Hub \> Analytics Hub Subscription Owner** .

9.  Click **Save** .

You can delete and update subscribers at any time by clicking **Set Permissions** .

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.dataExchanges.setIamPolicy  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges/setIamPolicy) .

The following example shows how to call the `  projects.locations.dataExchanges.setIamPolicy  ` method using the `  curl  ` command:

``` text
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -L -X POST https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/dataExchanges/CLEAN_ROOM_ID:setIamPolicy -d
'{
  "policy": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "members": [
          "user:mike@example.com"
        ],
        "role": "roles/analyticshub.subscriptionOwner"
      },
      {
        "members": [
          "user:mike@example.com"
        ],
        "role": "roles/analyticshub.subscriber"
      }
    ]
  }
}'
```

The policy in the request body should conform to the structure of a [Policy](/iam/reference/rest/v1/Policy) .

You can grant the Analytics Hub Subscriber role ( `  roles/analyticshub.subscriber  ` ) and Analytics Hub Subscription Owner role ( `  roles/analyticshub.subscriptionOwner  ` ) for an entire project from the [IAM page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin) , which gives a user permission to subscribe to any data clean room in a project. However, we don't recommend this action, as it might result in users having overly permissive access.

### Share a data clean room

You can directly share a data clean room with subscribers:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  In the row of the data clean room that you want to share, click more\_vert **More actions \> Copy share link** .

3.  Share the copied link with data clean room subscribers to let them view and subscribe to the data clean room.

## Data contributor workflows

As a data contributor, you can do the following:

  - Add data to a data clean room by creating a listing.
  - Update a listing.
  - Delete a listing.
  - Share a data clean room.
  - Monitor listings.

### Additional data contributor permissions

To perform data contributor tasks, you must have the [Analytics Hub Publisher role](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-publisher-role) ( `  roles/analyticshub.publisher  ` ) on a data clean room.

You also need the `  resourcemanager.organization.get  ` permission if you want to view data clean rooms in your organization that are not in your current project.

### Create a listing (add data)

**Note:** If your collaboration environment requires common identifiers to join data across data contributor and data clean room subscriber datasets, configure an [entity resolution](/bigquery/docs/entity-resolution-setup) before following these steps.

To prepare data with [analysis rules](/bigquery/docs/analysis-rules) and publish to a data clean room as a listing, do the following:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click the display name of the data clean room that you want to create a listing in.
    
    If you're in a different organization than your data clean room owner and the data clean room is not visible to you, ask the data clean room owner for a direct link.

3.  Click **Add data** .

4.  For **Select dataset** and **Table/view name** , enter the table or view that you want to list in the data clean room and its corresponding dataset. You will add analysis rules to prevent raw access to this underlying data in a few steps.

5.  Select the columns of your resource that you want to publish.

6.  Set the view name, primary contact, and description (optional) for the listing.

7.  Click **Next** .

8.  Choose an analysis rule for your listing and configure the details.

9.  Set [data egress](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction#data_egress) controls for the listing.

10. Click **Next** .

11. Review the data and analysis rule that you're adding to the data clean room.

12. Click **Add data** . A view is created for your data and is added as a listing to the data clean room. The source table or view itself isn't added.

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings.create  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings/create) .

The following example shows how to call the `  projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings.create  ` method using the `  curl  ` command:

``` text
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H 'x-goog-user-project:DCR_PROJECT_ID' -X POST https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/DCR_PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/dataExchanges/CLEAN_ROOM_ID/listings?listingId=LISTING_ID -d
  '{"bigqueryDataset":{"dataset":"projects/PROJECT_ID/datasets/DATASET_ID","selectedResources":[{"table":"projects/PROJECT_ID/datasets/DATASET_ID/tables/VIEW_ID"}],},"displayName":LISTING_NAME"}'
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DCR_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the project where the data clean room was created.
  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the project where the source dataset was contained.
  - `  DATASET_ID  ` : your source dataset ID.
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the location of the data clean room.
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_ID  ` : your data clean room ID.
  - `  LISTING_ID  ` : your listing ID.
  - `  LISTING_NAME  ` : your listing name.
  - `  VIEW_ID  ` : your view ID. The view that you add to a data clean room must be an [authorized view](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views) that is configured with [analysis rules](/bigquery/docs/analysis-rules) .

By listing a resource in a data clean room, you grant all current and future data clean room subscribers access to the data in your shared resource.

If you try to create a listing with a shared resource that doesn't have an analysis rule, you're shown a warning that subscribers will be able to access the raw data for that resource. If you confirm that you're willingly publishing such resources without analysis rules, you can still create the listing.

If you get the `  Failed to save listing  ` error, ensure that you have the [necessary permissions to perform data contributor tasks](#additional_data_contributor_permissions) .

### Update a listing

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click the display name of the data clean room that contains the listing.

3.  In the row of the listing that you want to update, click more\_vert **More actions \> Edit listing** .

4.  Update the primary contact or description as needed.

5.  Click **Next** .

6.  Update the analysis rule as needed. You can only update the parameters of the chosen rule. You can't switch to a different rule.

7.  Click **Next** .

8.  Review the listing and click **Add data** .

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings.patch  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings/patch) .

The following example shows how to call the `  projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings.patch  ` method using the `  curl  ` command:

``` text
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H 'x-goog-user-project:DCR_PROJECT_ID' -X PATCH https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/DCR_PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/dataExchanges/CLEAN_ROOM_ID/listings/listingId=LISTING_ID?updateMask=displayName -d
'{"displayName":LISTING_NAME"}'
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DCR_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the project where the clean room was created.
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the location of the data clean room.
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_ID  ` : your data clean room ID.
  - `  LISTING_ID  ` : your listing ID.
  - `  LISTING_NAME  ` : your listing name.

You can't change the source resource or data egress controls for a listing after it's created.

### Delete a listing

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click the display name of the data clean room that contains the listing.

3.  In the row of the listing that you want to delete, click more\_vert **More actions \> Delete listings** .

4.  To confirm, enter `  delete  ` , and then click **Delete** . You cannot undo this action.

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings.delete  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings/delete) .

The following example shows how to call the `  projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings.delete  ` method using the `  curl  ` command:

``` text
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H 'x-goog-user-project:DCR_PROJECT_ID' -X DELETE https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/DCR_PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/dataExchanges/CLEAN_ROOM_ID/listings?listingId=LISTING_ID
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DCR_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the project where the clean room was created.
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the location of the data clean room.
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_ID  ` : your data clean room ID.
  - `  LISTING_ID  ` : your listing ID.

When you delete a listing, the shared resources and linked datasets are not deleted. The linked datasets are unlinked from the source datasets, so querying data in that listing starts to fail for data clean room subscribers.

### Share a data clean room

You can directly share a data clean room with data clean room subscribers:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  In the row of the data clean room that you want to share, click more\_vert **More actions \> Copy share link** .

3.  Share the copied link with subscribers to let them view and subscribe to the data clean room.

### Monitor listings

You can view the usage metrics on the source datasets of the resources that you share in a data clean room by querying the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SHARED_DATASET_USAGE  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-shared-dataset-usage) .

To view your listing data clean room subscribers, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click the display name of the data clean room.

3.  In the row of a listing that you want to view, click more\_vert **More actions \> View subscriptions** .

## Data clean room subscriber workflows

A subscriber can view and subscribe to a data clean room. Subscribing to a data clean room creates one linked dataset in the subscriber's project. Each linked dataset has the same name as the data clean room.

You can't subscribe to a specific listing within a data clean room. You can only subscribe to the data clean room itself.

### Additional subscriber permissions

You must have the [Analytics Hub Subscriber](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-subscriber-role) ( `  roles/analyticshub.subscriber  ` ) on a data clean room and [Analytics Hub Subscription Owner](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-grant-roles#ah-subscription-owner-role) ( `  roles/analyticshub.subscriptionOwner  ` ) roles on the subscription project to perform subscriber tasks.

In addition, you need the `  bigquery.datasets.create  ` permission in a project to create a linked dataset when you subscribe to a clean room.

### Subscribe to a data clean room

Subscribing to a data clean room gives you query access to the data in the listings by creating a linked dataset in your project. To subscribe to a data clean room, do the following:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, click add\_box **Add data** .

3.  Select **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** . A discovery page opens.

4.  To display the data clean rooms that you have access to, in the filters list, select **Clean rooms** .

5.  Click the data clean room that you want to subscribe to. A description page of the data clean room opens. On this page, you can also see if the provider has enabled subscriber email logging.

6.  Click **Subscribe** .

7.  Select the destination project for the subscription and click **Subscribe** .

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.dataExchanges.subscribe  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges/subscribe) .

The following example shows how to call the `  projects.locations.dataExchanges.subscribe  ` method using the `  curl  ` command:

``` text
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -L -X POST https://analyticshub.googleapis.com/v1/projects/DCR_PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION/dataExchanges/CLEAN_ROOM_ID:subscribe  --data '{"destination":"projects/SUBSCRIBER_PROJECT_ID/locations/LOCATION","subscription":"SUBSCRIPTION"}'
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DCR_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the project where the clean room was created.
  - `  SUBSCRIBER_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the subscriber project.
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the location of the data clean room.
  - `  CLEAN_ROOM_ID  ` : your data clean room ID.
  - `  SUBSCRIPTION  ` : the name of your subscription.

In the body of the request, specify the dataset where you want to create the [linked dataset](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-introduction#linked_datasets) . If the request is successful, the response body contains the [subscription object](/bigquery/docs/reference/analytics-hub/rest/v1/projects.locations.dataExchanges.listings/subscribe#response-body) .

If you enable subscriber email logging for the data clean room with the `  logLinkedDatasetQueryUserEmail  ` field, the subscription response contains `  log_linked_dataset_query_user_email: true  ` . The logged data is available in the `  job_principal_subject  ` field of the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SHARED_DATASET_USAGE  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-shared-dataset-usage) .

A linked dataset is now added to the project that you specified and is available for query.

As a data clean room subscriber, you can edit some metadata of your linked datasets, such as description and labels. You can also set permissions on your linked datasets. However, changes to linked datasets don't affect the source datasets. You also can't see view definitions.

Resources that are contained in linked datasets are read-only. As a subscriber, you can't edit data or metadata for resources in linked datasets. You also can't specify permissions for individual resources within the linked dataset.

To unsubscribe to the data clean room, delete your linked dataset.

#### Query data in a linked dataset

To query data in a linked dataset, use the [`  SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD  ` syntax](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#agg_threshold_clause) , which lets you run queries on analysis rule-enforced views. For an example of this syntax, see [Query an aggregation threshold analysis rule–enforced view](/bigquery/docs/analysis-rules#view_in_privacy_query) .

## Example scenario: Advertiser and publisher attribution analysis

An advertiser wants to track the effectiveness of its marketing campaigns. The advertiser has first-party data on its customers, including their purchase history, demographics, and interests. The publisher has data from its website, including which ads were shown to visitors and their conversions.

The advertiser and publisher agree to use a data clean room to combine data and measure the results of their campaigns. In this case, the publisher creates the data clean room and makes their data available for the advertiser to perform the analysis. The result is an attribution report that shows the advertiser which ads were most effective in driving sales. The advertiser can then use this information to improve its future marketing campaigns.

The advertiser and publisher orchestrate the BigQuery data clean room through the process described in the following sections.

### Create the data clean room (publisher)

1.  A data clean room owner in the publisher organization enables the Analytics Hub API in their BigQuery project and assigns User A as the data clean room owner (Analytics Hub Admin ( `  roles/analyticshub.admin  ` )).
2.  User A creates a data clean room called `  Campaign Analysis  ` and assigns the following permissions:
      - Data contributor (Analytics Hub Publisher ( `  roles/analyticshub.publisher  ` )): User B, a data engineer in the publisher organization.
      - Data clean room subscriber (Analytics Hub Subscriber ( `  roles/analyticshub.subscriber  ` ) and Subscription Owner ( `  roles/analyticshub.subscriptionOwner  ` )): User C, a marketing analyst in the advertiser organization.

### Add data to the data clean room (publisher)

1.  User B creates a new listing in the data clean room called `  Publisher Conversion Data  ` . As part of listing creation, a new view with analysis rules is created.

### Subscribe to the data clean room (advertiser)

1.  User C subscribes to the data clean room, which creates a linked dataset for all listings in the data clean room, including the `  Publisher Conversion Data  ` listing.
2.  User C can now run aggregation queries to combine the data from this linked dataset with their first-party data to measure the campaign effectiveness.

## Entity resolution

Data clean room use cases often require linking entities across data contributor and data clean room subscriber datasets that don't include a common identifier. Subscribers and data contributors might represent the same records differently in multiple datasets, either because datasets originate from different data sources or because datasets use identifiers from different namespaces.

As a part of [data preparation](#add-data) , entity resolution in BigQuery does the following:

  - For data contributors, it deduplicates and resolves records in their shared resources by using identifiers from a common provider of their choice. This process enables cross-contributor joins.
  - For data clean room subscribers, it deduplicates and resolves records in their first-party datasets and links to entities in data contributor datasets. This process enables joins between subscriber and data contributor data.

To set up entity resolution with the identity provider of your choice, see [Configure and use entity resolution in BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/entity-resolution-setup) .

## Discover data clean room assets

To find all the data clean rooms that you have access to, do the following:

  - For data clean room owners and data contributors, in the Google Cloud console, go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.
    
    All the data clean rooms that you can access are listed.

  - For data clean room subscribers, do the following:
    
    1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.
    
    2.  In the **Explorer** pane, click add\_box **Add data** .
    
    3.  Select **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** . A discovery page opens.
    
    4.  To display the data clean rooms that you have access to, in the filters list, select **Clean rooms** .

To find all the linked datasets created by data clean rooms in your project, run the following command in a command-line environment:

``` text
PROJECT=PROJECT_ID \
for dataset in $(bq ls --project_id $PROJECT | tail +3); \
do [ "$(bq show -d --project_id $PROJECT $dataset | egrep LINKED)" ] \
&& echo $dataset; done
```

Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with the project that contains your linked datasets.

**Note:** Linked datasets also have a different icon than standard datasets in the **Explorer** pane.
