# Column-level encryption with Cloud KMS

You can use [Cloud Key Management Service (Cloud KMS)](/kms/docs/concepts) to encrypt the keys that in turn encrypt the values within BigQuery tables. You can use the [AEAD encryption functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead_encryption_functions) with Cloud KMS [keysets](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#keysets) or [wrapped keysets](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#wrapped_keysets) to provide a second layer of protection at the column level.

## Introduction

To provide an extra layer of protection, Cloud KMS encrypts your data encryption key (DEK) with a second key encryption key (KEK). In BigQuery, referencing an encrypted keyset instead of a plaintext keyset helps reduce the risk of key exposure. The KEK is a symmetric encryption keyset that is stored securely in Cloud KMS and managed using Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and permissions.

BigQuery supports deterministic and non-deterministic encryption functions. With deterministic encryption, if both the pieces of stored data and the additional authenticated data (optional) are identical, then the ciphertext is identical. This allows for support of aggregation and joins based on the encrypted column. With non-deterministic encryption, the stored ciphertext is unique regardless of the encrypted data, which prevents clustering, aggregation, and joins.

At query execution time, you provide the Cloud KMS resource path of the KEK and the ciphertext from the wrapped DEK. BigQuery calls Cloud KMS to unwrap the DEK, and then uses that key to decrypt the data in your query. The non-wrapped version of the DEK is only stored in memory for the duration of the query, and then destroyed.

If you use Cloud KMS in a [region](/kms/docs/ekm#regions) where [Cloud External Key Manager](/kms/docs/ekm) is supported, you can use Cloud EKM based keys in Cloud KMS.

**Note:** Using Cloud EKM keys might introduce additional latency to each key access.

### Use cases

Use cases for encryption with Cloud KMS keys include the following:

  - Externally encrypted data that needs to be stored in BigQuery without storing the keyset in plaintext. Your data can then be exported from the table or decrypted with a SQL query.
  - "Double access control" on encrypted data in BigQuery. A user must be granted permission to both the table and the encryption key to read data in cleartext.

**User Permission Matrix**

**Permission on Table**

**No Permission on Table**

**Permissions on Key**

Read and decrypt encrypted data.

No access.

**No Permissions on Key**

Read encrypted data.

No access.

If a user has permission to access the KMS key and has access to the wrapped keyset, SQL functions can unwrap the keyset and decrypt the ciphertext. Users can also use the Cloud KMS [REST API](/kms/docs/reference/rest) or [CLI](/bigquery/docs/customer-managed-encryption) to unwrap the keyset.  
The following query sample uses KMS SQL functions to decrypt non-deterministic ciphertext:

``` text
SELECT
  AEAD.DECRYPT_STRING(
    KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(@kms_resource_name, @first_level_keyset),
    ciphertext,
    additional_authenticated_data)
FROM
  ciphertext_table
WHERE
  ...
```

#### Use-case example

Assume an implementation where zip codes are considered sensitive information. Zip code data can be inserted into the BigQuery table using the AEAD encrypt function, thereby encrypting the `  Zipcode  ` column. In this example, we use the `  AEAD.ENCRYPT  ` function with the wrapped keyset management function. The `  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN  ` function decrypts the digital encryption key with the KEK, and the `  AEAD.ENCRYPT  ` function passes the information to KMS.

The keyset chain for encryption and decryption ensures that the data encryption key (DEK) is encrypted or wrapped with a KEK and passed with that KEK. The wrapped DEK is decrypted or unwrapped within the SQL function, and then used to encrypt or decrypt data.

The AEAD non-deterministic function can decrypt data when it is accessed by using the function in the query that is being run on the table.

The AEAD deterministic function can decrypt data when it is accessed by using the function in the query that is being run on the table and supports aggregation and joins using the encrypted data.

### Non-deterministic function syntax

The supported syntax for using non-deterministic functions includes the following:

``` text
AEAD.ENCRYPT(
  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(kms_resource_name, first_level_keyset),
  plaintext,
  additional_authenticated_data)
```

``` text
AEAD.DECRYPT_STRING(
  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(kms_resource_name, first_level_keyset),
  ciphertext,
  additional_authenticated_data)
```

``` text
AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES(
  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(kms_resource_name, first_level_keyset),
  ciphertext,
  additional_authenticated_data)
```

See [`  AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead_encryption_functions#aeaddecrypt_bytes) , [`  AEAD.ENCRYPT  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead_encryption_functions#aeadencrypt) , [`  AEAD.DECRYPT_STRING  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead_encryption_functions#aeaddecrypt_string) , and [`  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead_encryption_functions#keyskeyset_chain) function syntax.

### Deterministic function syntax

The supported syntax for using deterministic functions includes the following:

``` text
DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT(
  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(kms_resource_name, first_level_keyset),
  plaintext,
  additional_data)
```

``` text
DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_STRING(
  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(kms_resource_name, first_level_keyset),
  ciphertext,
  additional_data)
```

``` text
DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_BYTES(
  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(kms_resource_name, first_level_keyset),
  ciphertext,
  additional_data)
```

See [`  DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_BYTES  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead_encryption_functions#deterministic_decrypt_bytes) , [`  DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead_encryption_functions#deterministic_encrypt) , [`  DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_STRING  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead_encryption_functions#deterministic_decrypt_string) , and [`  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead_encryption_functions#keyskeyset_chain) function syntax.

## Roles and permissions

For a list of roles for Cloud KMS, see [Cloud KMS permissions and roles](/kms/docs/reference/permissions-and-roles#predefined) .

## Limitations

Encryption with Cloud KMS has the following limitations and restrictions:

  - The Cloud KMS keys are restricted to the same [region or multi-region](/kms/docs/locations) as the query. Using global Cloud KMS keys is disallowed for reliability reasons.

  - It is not possible to rotate a wrapped keyset using the `  KEYS.ROTATE_KEYSET  ` function.

  - The constant parameters in a BigQuery query are visible to users in the [diagnostic query plan](/bigquery/docs/query-plan-explanation) . This factor can affect the `  kms_resource_name  ` and `  first_level_keyset  ` parameters of the `  KEYSET_CHAIN  ` function. Keys are never exposed in plaintext, and permission to the Cloud KMS key is required to decrypt the wrapped keyset. This approach ensures that keys are not exposed through the diagnostic query plan unless the user has permission to decrypt the keyset.

  - Column-level encryption has the following limitations when used with type-based security classifications:
    
      - Column-level security: Users can only decrypt or encrypt data on columns that they are allowed to access.
    
      - Row-level security: Users can only decrypt data on rows that they are allowed to access.

  - Column-level SQL functions have no significant impact on performance when compared to the performance of raw encryption functions where the key data is sent in plaintext.

## Key management

The following sections contain common tasks you can perform with Cloud KMS keys.

### Create a keyset

You can create wrapped keysets or raw keysets. To do this, complete the steps in the following sections.

#### Create a raw keyset

Run the following query to create a keyset with a key of type `  DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256  ` .

``` text
SELECT KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256') AS raw_keyset
```

#### Create a wrapped keyset

Run the following query to create a Cloud KMS wrapped keyset with a key of type `  DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256  ` .

``` text
SELECT KEYS.NEW_WRAPPED_KEYSET(
  KMS_KEY,
  'DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256')
```

### Decode a keyset

Although SQL functions that return keysets produce the keysets in `  BYTES  ` format, the user-displayed result is encoded and displayed in `  STRING  ` format. If you would like to convert this encoded string to a decoded bytes sequence that you can use as literal key encryption functions, use the following query.

#### Decode a wrapped keyset

Run the following query to decode a Cloud KMS wrapped keyset.

``` text
SELECT FORMAT('%T', FROM_BASE64(WRAPPED_KEYSET_ENCODED'))
```

#### Decode a raw keyset

Run the following query to decode a raw keyset.

``` text
SELECT FORMAT('%T', FROM_BASE64(KEYSET_ENCODED'))
```

### Rewrap a wrapped keyset

Run the following query to rewrap a Cloud KMS wrapped keyset with a new Cloud KMS key. `  KMS_KEY_CURRENT  ` represents the new `  KMS_KEY  ` that is used to encrypt the keyset. `  KMS_KEY_NEW  ` represents the new `  KMS_KEY  ` that is used to encrypt the keyset.

``` text
SELECT KEYS.REWRAP_KEYSET(
  KMS_KEY_CURRENT,
  KMS_KEY_NEW,
  WRAPPED_KEYSET_DECODED)
```

### Rotate a wrapped keyset

Run the following query to rotate a Cloud KMS wrapped keyset with a key of type `  DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256  ` .

``` text
SELECT KEYS.ROTATE_WRAPPED_KEYSET(
  KMS_KEY,
  WRAPPED_KEYSET_DECODED,
  'DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256')
```

### Generate a raw keyset from a wrapped keyset

Some encryption functions require a raw keyset. To decrypt a Cloud KMS wrapped keyset to produce a raw keyset, complete the following steps.

1.  [Create a wrapped keyset](#wrap-keyset) .

2.  In the bq command-line tool enter the following commands to save a wrapped keyset in a file called `  keyset_to_unwrap  ` , decrypt the wrapped keyset, and produce the output in the `  KEYSET_DECODED  ` format:
    
    ``` text
    echo WRAPPED_KEYSET_ENCODED | base64 -d > /tmp/decoded_wrapped_key
    ```
    
    ``` text
    gcloud kms decrypt \
    --ciphertext-file=/tmp/decoded_wrapped_key \
    --key=KMS_KEY_SHORT \
    --plaintext-file=/tmp/keyset_to_unwrap.dec \
    --project=PROJECT_ID
    ```
    
    ``` text
    od -An --format=o1 /tmp/keyset_to_unwrap.dec | tr ' ' '\'
    ```

### Generate a wrapped keyset from a raw keyset

Some encryption functions require a Cloud KMS wrapped keyset. To encrypt a raw keyset to produce a wrapped keyset, complete the following steps.

1.  [Create a raw keyset](#raw-keyset) .

2.  In the bq command-line tool enter the following commands to save a raw keyset in a file called `  keyset_to_wrap  ` , encrypt the raw keyset, and produce the output in the `  WRAPPED_KEYSET_DECODED  ` format:
    
    ``` text
    echo KEYSET_ENCODED | base64 -d > /tmp/decoded_key
    ```
    
    ``` text
    gcloud kms encrypt \
    --plaintext-file=/tmp/decoded_key \
    --key=KMS_KEY_SHORT \
    --ciphertext-file=/tmp/keyset_to_wrap.dec \
    --project=PROJECT_ID
    ```
    
    ``` text
    od -An --format=o1 /tmp/keyset_to_wrap.dec | tr ' ' '\'
    ```

### Generate a wrapped key for a DLP function

For [DLP functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/dlp_functions) , you need a cryptographic key and then use that key to get a wrapped key.

1.  To generate a new cryptographic key, on the [command line](/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool) , run the following command. The size of the key can be 16, 24, or 32 bytes. The following example uses a 16-byte key:
    
    ``` text
    openssl rand 16 > rand.key.16.bin
    ```

2.  Wrap the generated 16-byte key with a [KMS key](/sdk/gcloud/reference/kms/encrypt) . See the following example:
    
    ``` text
    KEYRING=projects/myproject/locations/us/keyRings/kms-test
    KEY=projects/myproject/locations/us/keyRings/kms-test/cryptoKeys/test-Kek
    PROJECT="myproject"
    
    gcloud kms encrypt --project $PROJECT --location us --keyring $KEYRING --key $KEY --plaintext-file ./rand.key.16.bin --ciphertext-file ./rand.key.16.wrapped
    ```

3.  You can now get the `  BYTES  ` literal of the wrapped key or the base64 format of the wrapped key.
    
      - **Bytes literal**
        
        ``` text
        username:~/tmp$ od -b ./rand.key.16.wrapped | cut -d ' ' -f 2- | head -n -1 | sed  -e 's/^/ /' | tr ' ' '\'
        ```
        
        The output looks like the following:
        
        ``` text
        \012\044\000\325\155\264\153\246\071\172\130\372\305\103\047\342\356\061\077\014\030\126\147\041\126\150\012\036\020\202\215\044\267\310\331\014\116\233\022\071\000\363\344\230\067\274\007\340\273\016\212\151\226\064\200\377\303\207\103\147\052\267\035\350\004\147\365\251\271\133\062\251\246\152\177\017\005\270\044\141\211\116\337\043\035\263\122\340\110\333\266\220\377\247\204\215\233
        ```
    
      - **Base64 format**
        
        ``` text
        username:~/tmp$ base64 ./rand.key.16.wrapped
        ```
        
        The output looks like the following:
        
        ``` text
        CiQA1W20a6Y5elj6xUMn4u4xPwwYVmchVmgKHhCCjSS3yNkMTpsSOQDz5Jg3vAfguw6KaZY0gP/Dh0NnKrcd6ARn9am5WzKppmp/DwW4JGGJTt8jHbNS4EjbtpD/p4SNmw==
        ```

### Get the number of keys in a keyset

Run the following query to get the number of keys in a raw keyset.

1.  If you are working with a wrapped keyset, first [generate a raw keyset](#generate-raw-keyset) .

2.  Run this query with the raw keyset:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT KEYS.KEYSET_LENGTH(KEYSET_DECODED) as key_count;
    ```

### Get a JSON representation of a keyset

Run the following query to view a JSON representation of a raw keyset.

1.  If you are working with a wrapped keyset, first [generate a raw keyset](#generate-raw-keyset) .

2.  Run this query with the raw keyset:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT KEYS.KEYSET_TO_JSON(KEYSET_DECODED);
    ```

## Encryption and decryption

You can use raw keysets or wrapped keysets to encrypt a column in a table. You can also choose to use deterministic or non-deterministic encryption on your columns. The examples in this section use wrapped keysets but you could replace the wrapped keysets with raw keysets.

### Deterministically encrypt a column with a wrapped keyset

Run the following query to create a table and store a Cloud KMS wrapped keyset with deterministic encryption in a column called `  encrypted_content  ` .

1.  [Create a wrapped keyset](#wrap-keyset) .

2.  Encrypt a column with the wrapped keyset.
    
    ``` text
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE DATASET_NAME.TABLE_NAME AS
      SELECT DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT(
        KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(KMS_KEY, WRAPPED_KEYSET_DECODED),
        'plaintext',
        '') AS encrypted_content
    ```

### Deterministically decrypt a column with a wrapped keyset

Run the following query to deterministically decrypt a column that contains encrypted content, using a Cloud KMS wrapped keyset. This query assumes you are referencing a table with a column called `  encrypted_content  ` .

``` text
SELECT DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_STRING(
  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(KMS_KEY, WRAPPED_KEYSET_DECODED),
  encrypted_content,
  '')
FROM DATASET_NAME.TABLE_NAME
```

### Non-deterministically encrypt a column with a wrapped keyset

See [Deterministically encrypt a column with a wrapped keyset](#determine-encrypt-column) , but replace `  DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT  ` with `  AEAD.ENCRYPT  ` . Make sure that your keyset is of type `  AEAD_AES_GCM_256  ` .

### Non-deterministically decrypt a column with a wrapped keyset

See [Deterministically decrypt a column with a wrapped keyset](#determine-decrypt-column) , but replace `  DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_STRING  ` with `  AEAD.DECRYPT_STRING  ` . Make sure that your keyset is of type `  AEAD_AES_GCM_256  ` .
