# Work with raster data using Earth Engine in BigQuery

This document explains how to combine raster and vector data by using the [`  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions#st_regionstats) , which uses Google Earth Engine to get access to image and raster data in BigQuery.

## Overview

A *raster* is a two-dimensional grid of pixels, each of which is assigned one or more values called *bands* . For example, each pixel could correspond to one particular square kilometer on the earth's surface and have bands for average temperature and average rainfall. Raster data includes satellite imagery and other continuous, grid-based data such as weather forecasts and land cover. Many common image formats, such as PNG or JPEG files, are formatted as raster data.

Raster data is often contrasted with *vector* data, in which the data is described by lines or curves rather than a fixed rectangular grid. For example, you can use the `  GEOGRAPHY  ` data type in BigQuery to describe the boundaries of countries, cities, or other regions.

Geospatial raster and vector data is often combined using a *zonal statistics* operation, which computes an aggregate of all raster values within a given vector region. For example, you might want to compute the following:

  - Average air quality in a collection of cities.
  - Solar potential for a collection of building polygons.
  - Fire risk summarized along power line corridors in forested areas.

BigQuery excels in processing vector data, and Google Earth Engine excels in processing raster data. You can use the [`  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` geography function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions#st_regionstats) to combine raster data using Earth Engine with your vector data stored in BigQuery.

## Before you begin

1.  To use the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function in your queries, enable the Earth Engine API.

2.  Optional: To subscribe to and use data published to BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub) by using the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function, enable the Analytics Hub API.

### Required permissions

To get the permissions that you need to call the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your project:

  - [Earth Engine Resource Viewer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/earthengine#earthengine.viewer) ( `  roles/earthengine.viewer  ` )
  - [Service Usage Consumer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/serviceusage#serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer) ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer  ` )
  - Subscribe to datasets in BigQuery sharing: [BigQuery Data Editor](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataEditor) ( `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to call the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to call the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function:

  - `  earthengine.computations.create  `
  - `  serviceusage.services.use  `
  - `  bigquery.datasets.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Find raster data

The `  raster_id  ` parameter in the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function is a string that specifies the source of your raster data. The following sections explain how to find and format the raster ID.

### BigQuery image tables

You can use BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub) to discover and access raster datasets in BigQuery. To use BigQuery sharing, you need to [enable the Analytics Hub API](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-manage-exchanges#before_you_begin) and ensure that you have required permissions to [view and subscribe to listings and data exchanges](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-view-subscribe-listings) .

Google Earth Engine publishes publicly available datasets that contain raster data in the `  US  ` and `  EU  ` multi-regions. To [subscribe](/bigquery/docs/analytics-hub-view-subscribe-listings#subscribe-listings) to an Earth Engine dataset with raster data, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click search **Search listings** .

3.  In the **Search for listings** field, enter `  "Google Earth Engine"  ` .

4.  Click a dataset that you want to subscribe to.

5.  Click **Subscribe** .

6.  Optional: Update the **Project** or **Linked dataset name** fields.

7.  Click **Save** . The linked dataset is added to your project.

The dataset contains an *image table* that stores metadata for a collection of raster images following the [STAC](https://stacspec.org/) items specification. An image table is analogous to an Earth Engine image collection ( [`  ImageCollection  `](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/ic_creating) ).

Each row in the table corresponds to a single raster image, with columns containing image properties and metadata. The raster ID for each image is stored in the `  assets.image.href  ` column. Reference images in your queries using this ID as the `  raster_id  ` parameter value.

Filter the table using property columns to select specific images or image subsets that meet your criteria. For more information about available bands, pixel size, and property definitions, open the table and click the **Image details** tab.

Each image table includes a corresponding `  *_metadata  ` table that provides supporting information for the image table.

For example, the ERA5-Land dataset provides daily climate variable statistics and is publicly available. The `  climate  ` table contains multiple raster IDs. The following query filters the image table using the `  start_datetime  ` column to get the raster ID for the image corresponding to January 1, 2025 and computes the average temperature for each country using the `  temperature_2m  ` band:

### SQL

``` text
WITH SimplifiedCountries AS (
  SELECT
    ST_SIMPLIFY(geometry, 10000) AS simplified_geometry,
    names.primary AS name
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.overture_maps.division_area`
  WHERE
    subtype = 'country'
)
SELECT
  sc.simplified_geometry AS geometry,
  sc.name,
  ST_REGIONSTATS(
    sc.simplified_geometry,
    (SELECT assets.image.href
    FROM `LINKED_DATASET_NAME.climate`
    WHERE start_datetime = '2025-01-01 00:00:00'),
    'temperature_2m'
  ).mean - 273.15 AS mean_temperature
FROM
  SimplifiedCountries AS sc
ORDER BY
  mean_temperature DESC;
```

### BigQuery DataFrames

Before trying this sample, follow the BigQuery DataFrames setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using BigQuery DataFrames](/bigquery/docs/dataframes-quickstart) . For more information, see the [BigQuery DataFrames reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigframes/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up ADC for a local development environment](/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) .

``` python
import datetime
from typing import cast

import bigframes.bigquery as bbq
import bigframes.pandas as bpd

# TODO: Set the project_id to your Google Cloud project ID.
# project_id = "your-project-id"
bpd.options.bigquery.project = project_id

# TODO: Set the dataset_id to the ID of the dataset that contains the
# `climate` table. This is likely a linked dataset to Earth Engine.
# See: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/link-earth-engine
linked_dataset = "era5_land_daily_aggregated"

# For the best efficiency, use partial ordering mode.
bpd.options.bigquery.ordering_mode = "partial"

# Load the table of country boundaries.
countries = bpd.read_gbq("bigquery-public-data.overture_maps.division_area")

# Filter to just the countries.
countries = countries[countries["subtype"] == "country"].copy()
countries["name"] = countries["names"].struct.field("primary")
countries["simplified_geometry"] = bbq.st_simplify(
    countries["geometry"],
    tolerance_meters=10_000,
)

# Get the reference to the temperature data from a linked dataset.
# Note: This sample assumes you have a linked dataset to Earth Engine.
image_href = (
    bpd.read_gbq(f"{project_id}.{linked_dataset}.climate")
    .set_index("start_datetime")
    .loc[[datetime.datetime(2025, 1, 1, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc)], :]
)
raster_id = image_href["assets"].struct.field("image").struct.field("href")
raster_id = raster_id.item()
stats = bbq.st_regionstats(
    countries["simplified_geometry"],
    raster_id=cast(str, raster_id),
    band="temperature_2m",
)

# Extract the mean and convert from Kelvin to Celsius.
countries["mean_temperature"] = stats.struct.field("mean") - 273.15

# Sort by the mean temperature to find the warmest countries.
result = countries[["name", "mean_temperature"]].sort_values(
    "mean_temperature", ascending=False
)
print(result.head(10))
```

### Cloud Storage GeoTIFF

GeoTIFF is a common file format for storing geospatial raster data. The `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function supports raster data stored in the [Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/Earth_Engine_asset_from_cloud_geotiff) (COG) format in Cloud Storage buckets that are located in the following regions:

  - `  US  ` multi-region
  - `  us-central1  `
  - `  EU  ` multi-region
  - `  europe-west1  `

Provide the Cloud Storage URI as the raster ID, such as `  gs://bucket/folder/raster.tif  ` .

### Earth Engine image assets

The `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function supports passing an Earth Engine image asset path for the `  raster_id  ` argument. Earth Engine raster data is available as individual images or collections of images. These data exist in the `  US  ` region and are only compatible with queries that run in the `  US  ` region. To find the raster ID for an image, follow these steps:

1.  Search the [Earth Engine data catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) for the dataset that you're interested in.

2.  To open the description page for that entry, click the dataset name. The **Earth Engine Snippet** either describes a single image or a collection of images.
    
    If the Earth Engine snippet is of the form `  ee.Image('IMAGE_PATH')  ` , then the raster ID is `  'ee://IMAGE_PATH'  ` .
    
    If the Earth Engine snippet is of the form `  ee.ImageCollection(' IMAGE_COLLECTION_PATH ')  ` , you can use the [Earth Engine Code Editor](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/quickstart_javascript) to [filter the ImageCollection](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/ic_filtering) to a single image. Use the `  ee.Image.get('system:id')  ` method to print the `  IMAGE_PATH  ` value for that image to the console. The raster ID is `  'ee://IMAGE_PATH'  ` .

## Pixel weights

You can specify a *weight* , sometimes referred to as a *mask value* , for the `  include  ` parameter in the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function that determines how much to weight each pixel in calculations. Weight values must range from 0 to 1. Weights outside this range are set to the nearest limit, either 0 or 1.

A pixel is considered *valid* if it has a weight greater than 0. A weight of 0 indicates an *invalid* pixel. Invalid pixels usually represent missing or unreliable data, such as areas obscured by clouds, sensor anomalies, processing errors, or locations outside of a defined boundary.

If you don't specify a weight, each pixel is automatically weighted by the proportion of the pixel that falls within the geometry, allowing for proportional inclusion in zonal statistics. If the geometry is less than 1/256 of the size of the pixel, the weight of the pixel is 0. In these cases, `  null  ` is returned for all statistics except `  count  ` and `  area  ` , which are 0.

If a partially intersecting pixel has a weight from the `  include  ` argument to `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` , then BigQuery uses the minimum of that weight and the fraction of the pixel that intersects the region.

Weight values don't have the same precision as `  FLOAT64  ` values. In practice, their true value might differ from the value used in computations by up to 1/256 (about 0.4%).

You can provide an expression using Earth Engine [image expression syntax](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/image_math#expressions) in your `  include  ` argument to dynamically weight pixels based on specific criteria within raster bands. For example, the following expression restricts calculations to pixels where the `  probability  ` band exceeds 70%:

``` text
include => 'probability > 0.7'
```

If the dataset includes a weight-factor band, you can use it with the following syntax:

``` text
include => 'weight_factor_band_name'
```

## Pixel size and scale of analysis

A geospatial raster image is a grid of pixels that corresponds to some location on the surface of the Earth. The pixel size of a raster, sometimes called the *scale* , is the nominal size of one edge of a pixel in the grid's coordinate reference system. For example, a raster with 10-meter resolution has pixels of size 10 meters by 10 meters. Original reported pixel size can vary dramatically between datasets, from less than 1 meter to greater than 20 kilometers.

When using the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function to compute zonal statistics, the pixel size of the raster data is a crucial consideration. For example, aggregating high-resolution raster data over the region of a country can be computationally intensive and unnecessarily granular. Conversely, aggregating low-resolution data over the region, such as city parcels, might not provide sufficient detail.

To get meaningful and efficient results from your analysis, we recommend choosing a pixel size appropriate for the size of your polygons and the objective of your analysis. You can find the pixel size for each raster dataset in the description section of image tables in BigQuery sharing.

Changing the pixel size changes the number of pixels that intersect a given geography, which affects the results and their interpretation. We don't recommend changing the pixel size for production analyses. However, if you're prototyping a query, increasing the pixel size can reduce query runtime and cost, especially for high-resolution data.

To change the pixel size, set the `  scale  ` in the `  options  ` argument to the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function. For example, to compute statistics over 1,000-meter pixels, use `  options => JSON '{"scale":1000}'  ` , which tells Earth Engine to resample the image at the requested scale. To learn more about how Earth Engine handles rescaling, see [Scale](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/scale) in the Google Earth Engine documentation.

Computing statistics for polygons that are significantly smaller than the pixels of the raster can produce inaccurate or null results. In such a case, one alternative is to replace the polygon with its centroid point using [`  ST_CENTROID  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions#st_centroid) .

## Billing

When you run a query, usage of the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function is billed separately from the rest of the query because Earth Engine computes the results of the function call. You are billed for this usage in slot hours under the BigQuery Services SKU, regardless of whether you use on-demand billing or reservations. To see the amount billed for BigQuery calls to Earth Engine, [view your billing report](/billing/docs/how-to/reports#overview) and use [labels](/billing/docs/how-to/reports#filter-by-labels) to filter by the label key `  goog-bq-feature-type  ` , with value `  EARTH_ENGINE  ` . If the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function fails, then you aren't billed for any Earth Engine computation that was used.

For each query, you can use the [`  jobs.get  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/get) in the BigQuery API to see the following information:

  - The [`  slotMs  ` field](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#externalservicecost) , which shows the number of slot milliseconds consumed by Earth Engine when the `  externalService  ` field is `  EARTH_ENGINE  ` and the `  billingMethod  ` field is `  SERVICES_SKU  ` .
  - The [`  totalServicesSkuSlotMs  ` field](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#jobstatistics2) , which shows the total number of slot milliseconds used by all BigQuery external services that get billed on the BigQuery Services SKU.

You can also query the `  total_services_sku_slot_ms  ` field in the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs) to find the total slot milliseconds consumed by external services billed on the BigQuery Services SKU.

### Cost factors

The following factors impact the compute usage when you run the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function:

  - The number of input rows.

  - The raster image that you use. Some rasters are composites created from source image collections in the Earth Engine data catalog, and the computational resources to produce the composite result varies.

  - The resolution of the image.

  - The size and complexity of the input geography, number of pixels that intersect the geography, and the number of image tiles and bytes read by Earth Engine.

  - The location of the input geography on Earth relative to the source images and the image's projection and resolution.
    
      - Image projections can warp pixels, especially pixels at high latitudes or far outside the image's intended coverage area.
      - For composite rasters, the number of source images intersecting the input geography can vary regionally and over time. For example, some satellites produce more images at low or high latitudes, depending on their orbit and data collection parameters, or may omit images depending on changing atmospheric conditions.

  - The use of formulas in the `  include  ` or `  band_name  ` arguments, and the number of bands they involve.

  - The caching of previous results.

### Control costs

To control costs associated with the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function, you can adjust the quota that controls the amount of slot time that the function is allowed to consume. The default is 350 slot-hours per day. When you [view your quotas](/docs/quotas/view-manage) , filter the **Metric** list to `  earthengine.googleapis.com/bigquery_slot_usage_time  ` to see the Earth Engine quota associated with calls from BigQuery. For more information, read about [BigQuery raster functions quotas](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/usage#bigquery_slot-time_per_day) in the Google Earth Engine documentation.

**Note:** Like custom query quotas in BigQuery, this quota is approximate. It provides a safeguard against excessive spending, but it's not designed to strictly limit slot time. BigQuery might occasionally run a query that exceeds the quota limit, and you might exhaust your quota without being billed for the entire consumed amount.

## Supported regions

Queries that call the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function must run in one of the following regions:

  - `  US  ` multi-region
  - `  us-central1  `
  - `  us-central2  `
  - `  EU  ` multi-region
  - `  europe-west1  `
