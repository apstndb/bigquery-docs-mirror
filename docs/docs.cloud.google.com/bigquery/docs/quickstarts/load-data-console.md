# Load and query data

Get started with BigQuery by creating a dataset, loading data into a table, and querying the table.

To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the Google Cloud console, click **Guide me** :

## Before you begin

1.  Enable the BigQuery API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    For new projects, the BigQuery API is automatically enabled.

2.  Optional: [Enable billing](/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) for the project. If you don't want to enable billing or provide a credit card, the steps in this document still work. BigQuery provides you a sandbox to perform the steps. For more information, see [Enable the BigQuery sandbox](/bigquery/docs/sandbox#setup) .
    
    **Note:** If your project has a billing account and you want to use the BigQuery sandbox, then [disable billing for your project](/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project#disable_billing_for_a_project) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a dataset, create a table, load data, and query data, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project:

  - Run load jobs and query jobs: [BigQuery Job User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` )
  - Create a dataset, create a table, load data into a table, and query a table: [BigQuery Data Editor](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataEditor) ( `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Create a BigQuery dataset

Use the Google Cloud console to create a dataset to store the data. You create your dataset in the US multi-region location. For information on BigQuery regions and multi-regions, see [Locations](/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations) .

In the Google Cloud console, open the BigQuery page.

In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** .

In the **Explorer** pane, click your project name.

Click more\_vert **View actions** .

Select **Create dataset** .

On the **Create dataset** page, do the following:

1.  For **Dataset ID** , enter `  babynames  ` .
2.  For **Location type** , select **Multi-region** , and then choose **US (multiple regions in United States)** . The public datasets are stored in the `  us  ` multi-region location. For simplicity, store your dataset in the same location.
3.  Leave the remaining default settings as they are, and click **Create dataset** .

## Download the file that contains the source data

The file that you're downloading contains approximately 7 MB of data about popular baby names. It's provided by the US Social Security Administration.

For more information about the data, see the Social Security Administration's [Background information for popular names](http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/background.html) .

1.  Download the US Social Security Administration's data by opening the following URL in a new browser tab:
    
    ``` text
    https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/names.zip
    ```

2.  Extract the file.
    
    For more information about the dataset schema, see the zip file's `  NationalReadMe.pdf  ` file.

3.  To see what the data looks like, open the `  yob2024.txt  ` file. This file contains comma-separated values for name, assigned sex at birth, and number of children with that name. The file has no header row.

4.  Note the location of the `  yob2024.txt  ` file so that you can find it later.

## Load data into a table

Next, load the data into a new table.

In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** .

In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project name.

Click **Datasets** and then next to the **babynames** dataset, click more\_vert **View actions** and select **Open** .

Click add\_box **Create table** .

Unless otherwise indicated, use the default values for all settings.

On the **Create table** page, do the following:

1.  In the **Source** section, for **Create table from** , choose **Upload** from the list.

2.  In the **Select file** field, click **Browse** .

3.  Navigate to and open your local `  yob2024.txt  ` file, and click **Open** .

4.  From the **File format** list, choose **CSV** .

5.  In the **Destination** section, in the **Table** field, enter `  names_2024  ` .

6.  In the **Schema** section, click the **Edit as text** toggle, and paste the following schema definition into the text field:

7.  Click **Create table** .
    
    Wait for BigQuery to create the table and load the data.

## Preview table data

To preview the table data, follow these steps:

1.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** .
2.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Datasets** .
3.  Click the `  babynames  ` dataset, and then select the `  names_2024  ` table.
4.  Click the **Preview** tab. BigQuery displays the first few rows of the table.

The **Preview** tab is not available for all table types. For example, the **Preview** tab is not displayed for external tables or views.

## Query table data

Next, query the table.

1.  Next to the **names\_2024** tab, click the add\_box **SQL query** option. A new editor tab opens.

2.  In the query editor, paste the following query. This query retrieves the top five names for babies born in the US that were assigned male at birth in 2024.  
    
    ``` text
      SELECT
        name,
        count
      FROM
        `babynames.names_2024`
      WHERE
        assigned_sex_at_birth = 'M'
      ORDER BY
        count DESC
      LIMIT
        5;
      
    ```

3.  Click **Run** . The results are displayed in the **Query results** section.  

You have successfully queried a table in a public dataset and then loaded your sample data into BigQuery using the Google Cloud console.

## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used on this page, follow these steps.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, open the BigQuery page.
2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** .
3.  In the **Explorer** pane, click **Datasets** and then click the `  babynames  ` dataset that you created.
4.  Expand the more\_vert **View actions** option and click **Delete** .
5.  In the **Delete dataset** dialog, confirm the delete command: type the word `  delete  ` and then click **Delete** .
