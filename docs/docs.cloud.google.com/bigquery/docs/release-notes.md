  - To streamline resource discovery and access, the [left Explorer pane](/bigquery/docs/bigquery-web-ui#explorer_panel) has been reorganized into three sections: Explorer, Classic Explorer, and Git repository. You can still use the Classic Explorer, which provides the complete resources tree.

  - In the Explorer pane, you can use the [search feature](/bigquery/docs/bigquery-web-ui#explorer_pane) to find BigQuery resources in your organization. The results appear in a new tab in the details pane. You can use filters to narrow your search.

  - You can access job histories by clicking [Job history](/bigquery/docs/managing-jobs) in the Explorer pane. A new tab opens that displays a list of job histories. BigQuery Studio no longer has a bottom pane for job history.

  - To reduce tab proliferation, clicking a resource opens it within the same tab. To open the resource in a separate tab, press Ctrl (or Command on macOS) and click the resource. To prevent the current tab from getting its content replaced, double-click the tab. The name changes from italicized to regular font. If you still lose your resource, you can click tab\_recent Recent tabs in the details pane to find the resource.

  - You can use breadcrumbs to navigate through different tabs and resources in the details pane.

  - In the Home tab, the [What's new section](/bigquery/docs/bigquery-web-ui#welcome_tab) contains a list of new capabilities and changes to the BigQuery Studio.

  - The notebook action bar is consolidated by default to give you more screen space for writing code.

Feature

You can now access repositories by clicking Repositories in the Explorer pane. A new tab opens that displays a list of repositories. The Explorer pane no longer has a bottom pane for repositories. When you open a workspace in a repository, it opens in the Git repository pane in the left pane.

Feature

You can now use [repositories](/bigquery/docs/repository-intro) and [workspaces](/bigquery/docs/workspaces-intro) in BigQuery to perform version control.

Repositories perform version control on files by using Git to record changes and manage file versions. You can use workspaces within repositories to edit the code stored in the repository.

You can have a repository use Git directly on BigQuery, or you can [connect a repository to a third-party Git provider](/bigquery/docs/repositories#connect-third-party) .

This feature is in [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

Feature

Use the [`  ML.GENERATE_TEXT  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-generate-text) with these remote models to perform generative natural language tasks for text stored in BigQuery tables. Try this feature with the [Generate text by using the `  ML.GENERATE_TEXT  ` function](/bigquery/docs/generate-text) tutorial.

You can also evaluate Claude models by using the [`  ML.EVALUATE  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-evaluate) .
