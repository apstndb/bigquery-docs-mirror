This tutorial teaches you how to use the [`  AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-ai-detect-anomalies) with BigQuery ML's built-in [TimesFM model](/bigquery/docs/timesfm-model) to detect anomalies in time series data.

This tutorial uses data from the public [`  bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips  `](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=san_francisco_bikeshare&t=bikeshare_trips&page=table) table.

## Objectives

This tutorial guides you through using the `  AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES  ` function with the built-in TimesFM model to detect anomalies in bike share trips. The first section covers how to detect anomalies and visualize results for a single time series. The second section covers how to detect anomalies for multiple time series.

## Before you begin

Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads.

In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.

**Roles required to select or create a project**

  - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
  - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

**Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

## Detect anomalies in a single bike share trips time series

Detect anomalies in time series data by using the `  AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES  ` function.

The following query detects anomalies in the number of bike share trips per hour for the month of August 2017, based on the historical data from the previous month. The `  anomaly_prob_threshold  ` argument indicates the threshold for identifying an anomaly.

Follow these steps to detect anomalies with the TimesFM model:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** , the query takes 1-2 minutes to complete:
    
    ``` text
    WITH
      bike_share_trips AS (
        SELECT
          TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(start_date, HOUR) AS trip_hour, COUNT(*) AS num_trips
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
        GROUP BY TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(start_date, HOUR)
      )
    SELECT *
    FROM
      AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES(
        (
          SELECT *
          FROM bike_share_trips
          WHERE trip_hour >= TIMESTAMP('2017-07-01') AND trip_hour < TIMESTAMP('2017-08-01')
        ),
        (
          SELECT *
          FROM bike_share_trips
          WHERE trip_hour >= TIMESTAMP('2017-08-01') AND trip_hour < TIMESTAMP('2017-09-01')
        ),
        anomaly_prob_threshold => 0.95,
        timestamp_col => 'trip_hour',
        data_col => 'num_trips');
    ```
    
    The results look similar to the following:
    
    ``` console
    +-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
    | time_series_timestamp   | time_series_data | is_anomaly | lower_bound        | upper_bound         | anomaly_probability | ai_detect_anomalies_status|
    +-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
    | 2017-08-01 00:00:00 UTC | 13.0             | false      | -1.97939332204...  | 27.604928623830...  | 0.38048622012138... |                           |
    +-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
    | 2017-08-01 01:00:00 UTC | 6.0              | false      | -9.42939322810...  | 20.154928628380...  | 0.38048622012138... |                           |
    +-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
    | ...                     | ...              | ...        | ...                | ...                 | ...                 | ...                       |
    +-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
    ```

3.  When the query is finished running, click the **Visualization** tab. The resulting chart looks similar to the following:
    
    You can identify the anomalies where the `  time_series_data  ` value falls outside the `  lower_bound  ` and `  upper_bound  ` range.

## Detect anomalies in multiple bike share trips time series

The following query detects anomalies in the number of bike share trips per subscriber type and per hour for the month of August 2017, based on the historical data from the previous month.

Follow these steps to detect anomalies with the TimesFM model:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, paste in the following query and click **Run** :
    
    ``` text
    WITH
      bike_share_trips AS (
        SELECT
          TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(start_date, HOUR) AS trip_hour, COUNT(*) AS num_trips, subscriber_type
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
        GROUP BY TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(start_date, HOUR), subscriber_type
      )
    SELECT *
    FROM
      AI.DETECT_ANOMALIES(
        (
          SELECT *
          FROM bike_share_trips
          WHERE trip_hour >= TIMESTAMP('2017-07-01') AND trip_hour < TIMESTAMP('2017-08-01')
        ),
        (
          SELECT *
          FROM bike_share_trips
          WHERE trip_hour >= TIMESTAMP('2017-08-01') AND trip_hour < TIMESTAMP('2017-09-01')
        ),
        anomaly_prob_threshold => 0.95,
        timestamp_col => 'trip_hour',
        data_col => 'num_trips',
        id_cols => ['subscriber_type']);
    ```
    
    The results look similar to the following:
    
    ``` console
    +-----------------+-------------------------+------------------+------------+--------------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------------------+
    | subscriber_type | time_series_timestamp   | time_series_data | is_anomaly | lower_bound        | upper_bound         | anomaly_probability | ai_detect_anomalies_status|

## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and delete the individual resources.

### Delete your project

To delete the project:

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `  appspot.com  ` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
