# Audit policy tags

This document describes how to use [Cloud Logging](/logging/docs) to audit activities related to policy tags. For example, you can determine:

  - The email address for the principal that grants or removes access on a policy tag

  - The email address for whom the access was granted or removed

  - The policy tag whose access was changed

## Access to logs

For information about the permission you need to view logs, see the [Cloud Logging access control guide](/logging/docs/access-control) .

## Viewing logs for policy tag events

1.  Go to the **Logs Explorer** page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  In the resources drop-down list, click **Audited Resource** , click **Audited Resources** again, and then click **datacatalog.googleapis.com** . You will see recent audit log entries of Data Catalog resources.

3.  To view the log entries, select the Data Catalog `  SetIamPolicy  ` method.

4.  Click the log entry to see details about the call to the `  SetIamPolicy  ` method.

5.  Click the log entry fields to see details for the `  SetIamPolicy  ` entry.
    
      - Click `  protoPayload  ` , then click `  authenticationInfo  ` to see the `  principalEmail  ` for the entity that set the IAM policy.
