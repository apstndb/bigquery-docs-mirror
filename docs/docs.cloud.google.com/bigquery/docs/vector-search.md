# Search embeddings with vector search

This tutorial shows you how to perform a [similarity search](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_search) on embeddings stored in BigQuery tables by using the [`  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/search_functions#vector_search) and optionally a [vector index](/bigquery/docs/vector-index) .

When you use `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` with a vector index, `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` uses the [Approximate Nearest Neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Approximation_methods) method to improve vector search performance, with the trade-off of reducing [recall](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall#recallsearch_term_rules) and so returning more approximate results. Without a vector index, `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` uses [brute force search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search) to measure distance for every record.

## Required permissions

To run this tutorial, you need the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions:

  - To create a dataset, you need the `  bigquery.datasets.create  ` permission.

  - To create a table, you need the following permissions:
    
      - `  bigquery.tables.create  `
      - `  bigquery.tables.updateData  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

  - To create a vector index, you need the `  bigquery.tables.createIndex  ` permission on the table where you're creating the index.

  - To drop a vector index, you need the `  bigquery.tables.deleteIndex  ` permission on the table where you're dropping the index.

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need to work with vector indexes:

  - BigQuery Data Owner ( `  roles/bigquery.dataOwner  ` )
  - BigQuery Data Editor ( `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` )

## Costs

The `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` function uses [BigQuery compute pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#analysis_pricing_models) . You are charged for similarity search, using on-demand or editions pricing.

  - On-demand: You are charged for the amount of bytes scanned in the base table, the index, and the search query.

  - Editions pricing: You are charged for the slots required to complete the job within your reservation edition. Larger, more complex similarity calculations incur more charges.
    
    **Note:** Using an index isn't supported in [Standard editions](/bigquery/docs/editions-intro) .

For more information, see [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) .

## Before you begin

1.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
    
    **Roles required to select or create a project**
    
      - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
      - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

2.  [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

3.  Enable the BigQuery API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

## Create a dataset

Create a BigQuery dataset:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, click your project name.

3.  Click more\_vert **View actions \> Create dataset** .

4.  On the **Create dataset** page, do the following:
    
      - For **Dataset ID** , enter `  vector_search  ` .
    
      - For **Location type** , select **Multi-region** , and then select **US (multiple regions in United States)** .
        
        The public datasets are stored in the `  US  ` [multi-region](/bigquery/docs/locations#multi-regions) . For simplicity, store your dataset in the same location.
    
      - Leave the remaining default settings as they are, and click **Create dataset** .

## Create test tables

1.  Create the `  patents  ` table that contains patents embeddings, based on a subset of the [Google Patents](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google_patents_public_datasets/google-patents-public-data) public dataset:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE TABLE vector_search.patents AS
    SELECT * FROM `patents-public-data.google_patents_research.publications`
    WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(embedding_v1) > 0
     AND publication_number NOT IN ('KR-20180122872-A')
    LIMIT 1000000;
    ```

2.  Create the `  patents2  ` table that contains a patent embedding to find nearest neighbors for:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE TABLE vector_search.patents2 AS
    SELECT * FROM `patents-public-data.google_patents_research.publications`
    WHERE publication_number = 'KR-20180122872-A';
    ```

## Create a vector index

1.  Create the `  my_index  ` vector index on the `  embeddings_v1  ` column of the `  patents  ` table:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE OR REPLACE VECTOR INDEX my_index ON vector_search.patents(embedding_v1)
    STORING(publication_number, title)
    OPTIONS(distance_type='COSINE', index_type='IVF');
    ```

2.  Wait several minutes for the vector index to be created, then run the following query and confirm that the `  coverage_percentage  ` value is `  100  ` :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT * FROM vector_search.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.VECTOR_INDEXES;
    ```

## Use the `     VECTOR_SEARCH    ` function with an index

After the vector index is created and populated, use the `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` function to find the nearest neighbor for the embedding in the `  embedding_v1  ` column in the `  patents2  ` table. This query uses the vector index in the search, so `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` uses an [Approximate Nearest Neighbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Approximation_methods) method to find the embedding's nearest neighbor.

**Note:** Vector indexes are more effective on large datasets. If you want to see this in action, [recreate the `  vector_search.patents  ` table](/bigquery/docs/vector-search#create_test_tables) without the `  LIMIT 1000000  ` clause, [recreate the vector index](/bigquery/docs/vector-search#create_a_vector_index) , and then run the following query.

Use the `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` function with an index:

``` text
SELECT query.publication_number AS query_publication_number,
  query.title AS query_title,
  base.publication_number AS base_publication_number,
  base.title AS base_title,
  distance
FROM
  VECTOR_SEARCH(
    TABLE vector_search.patents,
    'embedding_v1',
    TABLE vector_search.patents2,
    top_k => 5,
    distance_type => 'COSINE',
    options => '{"fraction_lists_to_search": 0.005}');
```

The results look similar to the following:

``` console
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+

## Use the `     VECTOR_SEARCH    ` function with brute force

Use the `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` function to find the nearest neighbor for the embedding in the `  embedding_v1  ` column in the `  patents2  ` table. This query doesn't use the vector index in the search, so `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` finds the embedding's exact nearest neighbor.

``` text
SELECT query.publication_number AS query_publication_number,
  query.title AS query_title,
  base.publication_number AS base_publication_number,
  base.title AS base_title,
  distance
FROM
  VECTOR_SEARCH(
    TABLE vector_search.patents,
    'embedding_v1',
    TABLE vector_search.patents2,
    top_k => 5,
    distance_type => 'COSINE',
    options => '{"use_brute_force":true}');
```

The results look similar to the following:

``` console
+--------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------+
| query_publication_number |                         query_title                         | base_publication_number |                                                        base_title                                                        |      distance       |

## Evaluate recall

When you perform a vector search with an index, it returns approximate results, with the trade-off of reducing [recall](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/precision-and-recall#recallsearch_term_rules) . You can compute recall by comparing the results returned by vector search with an index and by vector search with brute force. In this dataset, the `  publication_number  ` value uniquely identifies a patent, so it is used for comparison.

``` text
WITH approx_results AS (
  SELECT query.publication_number AS query_publication_number,
    base.publication_number AS base_publication_number
  FROM
    VECTOR_SEARCH(
      TABLE vector_search.patents,
      'embedding_v1',
      TABLE vector_search.patents2,
      top_k => 5,
      distance_type => 'COSINE',
      options => '{"fraction_lists_to_search": 0.005}')
),
  exact_results AS (
  SELECT query.publication_number AS query_publication_number,
    base.publication_number AS base_publication_number
  FROM
    VECTOR_SEARCH(
      TABLE vector_search.patents,
      'embedding_v1',
      TABLE vector_search.patents2,
      top_k => 5,
      distance_type => 'COSINE',
      options => '{"use_brute_force":true}')
)

SELECT
  a.query_publication_number,
  SUM(CASE WHEN a.base_publication_number = e.base_publication_number THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / 5 AS recall
FROM exact_results e LEFT JOIN approx_results a
  ON e.query_publication_number = a.query_publication_number
GROUP BY a.query_publication_number
```

If the recall is lower than you would like, you can increase the `  fraction_lists_to_search  ` value, with the downside of potentially higher latency and resource usage. To tune your vector search, you can try multiple runs of `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` with different argument values, save the results to tables, and then compare the results.

## Clean up

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `  appspot.com  ` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
