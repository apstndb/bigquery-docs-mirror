In GoogleSQL for BigQuery, an array is an ordered list consisting of zero or more values of the same data type. You can construct arrays of a simple data type, such as `  INT64  ` , or a complex data type, such as `  STRUCT  ` . However, arrays of arrays aren't supported. To learn more about the `  ARRAY  ` data type, including `  NULL  ` handling, see [Array type](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#array_type) .

With GoogleSQL, you can construct array literals, build arrays from subqueries using the [`  ARRAY  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/array_functions) function, and aggregate values into an array using the [`  ARRAY_AGG  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#array_agg) function.

You can combine arrays using functions like `  ARRAY_CONCAT()  ` , and convert arrays to strings using `  ARRAY_TO_STRING()  ` .

## Accessing array elements

Consider the following table called `  Sequences  ` . This table contains the column `  some_numbers  ` of the `  ARRAY  ` data type.

``` text
WITH
  Sequences AS (
    SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers UNION ALL
    SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] UNION ALL
    SELECT [5, 10]
  )
SELECT * FROM Sequences

/*---------------------+
 | some_numbers        |
 +---------------------+
 | [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]  |
 | [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]   |
 | [5, 10]             |
 +---------------------*/
```

To access array elements in the `  some_numbers  ` column, specify which type of indexing you want to use: either [`  index  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#array_subscript_operator) or [`  OFFSET(index)  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#array_subscript_operator) for zero-based indexes, or [`  ORDINAL(index)  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#array_subscript_operator) for one-based indexes.

For example:

``` text
SELECT
  some_numbers,
  some_numbers[0] AS index_0,
  some_numbers[OFFSET(1)] AS offset_1,
  some_numbers[ORDINAL(1)] AS ordinal_1
FROM Sequences

/*--------------------+---------+----------+-----------+
 | some_numbers       | index_0 | offset_1 | ordinal_1 |
 +--------------------+---------+----------+-----------+
 | [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] | 0       | 1        | 0         |
 | [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]  | 2       | 4        | 2         |
 | [5, 10]            | 5       | 10       | 5         |
 +--------------------+---------+----------+-----------*/
```

**Note:** `  OFFSET  ` and `  ORDINAL  ` will raise errors if the index is out of range. To avoid this, you can use `  SAFE_OFFSET  ` or `  SAFE_ORDINAL  ` to return `  NULL  ` instead of raising an error.

## Finding lengths

The `  ARRAY_LENGTH  ` function returns the length of an array.

``` text
WITH Sequences AS
  (SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [5, 10] AS some_numbers)
SELECT some_numbers,
       ARRAY_LENGTH(some_numbers) AS len
FROM Sequences;

/*--------------------+--------+
 | some_numbers       | len    |
 +--------------------+--------+
 | [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] | 6      |
 | [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]  | 5      |
 | [5, 10]            | 2      |
 +--------------------+--------*/
```

## Converting elements in an array to rows in a table

To convert an `  ARRAY  ` into a set of rows, also known as "flattening," use the [`  UNNEST  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unnest_operator) operator. `  UNNEST  ` takes an `  ARRAY  ` and returns a table with a single row for each element in the `  ARRAY  ` .

Because `  UNNEST  ` destroys the order of the `  ARRAY  ` elements, you may wish to restore order to the table. To do so, use the optional `  WITH OFFSET  ` clause to return an additional column with the offset for each array element, then use the `  ORDER BY  ` clause to order the rows by their offset.

**Example**

``` text
SELECT *
FROM UNNEST(['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'qux', 'corge', 'garply', 'waldo', 'fred'])
  AS element
WITH OFFSET AS offset
ORDER BY offset;

/*----------+--------+
 | element  | offset |
 +----------+--------+
 | foo      | 0      |
 | bar      | 1      |
 | baz      | 2      |
 | qux      | 3      |
 | corge    | 4      |
 | garply   | 5      |
 | waldo    | 6      |
 | fred     | 7      |
 +----------+--------*/
```

To flatten an entire column of type `  ARRAY  ` while preserving the values of the other columns in each row, use a correlated [`  INNER JOIN  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#inner_join) to join the table containing the `  ARRAY  ` column to the `  UNNEST  ` output of that `  ARRAY  ` column.

With a [correlated](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#correlated_join) join, the `  UNNEST  ` operator references the `  ARRAY  ` typed column from each row in the source table, which appears previously in the `  FROM  ` clause. For each row `  N  ` in the source table, `  UNNEST  ` flattens the `  ARRAY  ` from row `  N  ` into a set of rows containing the `  ARRAY  ` elements, and then a correlated `  INNER JOIN  ` or `  CROSS JOIN  ` combines this new set of rows with the single row `  N  ` from the source table.

**Examples**

The following example uses [`  UNNEST  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unnest_operator) to return a row for each element in the array column. Because of the `  INNER JOIN  ` , the `  id  ` column contains the `  id  ` values for the row in `  Sequences  ` that contains each number.

``` text
WITH
  Sequences AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id, [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
    UNION ALL SELECT 2 AS id, [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
    UNION ALL SELECT 3 AS id, [5, 10] AS some_numbers
  )
SELECT id, flattened_numbers
FROM Sequences
INNER JOIN UNNEST(Sequences.some_numbers) AS flattened_numbers;

/*------+-------------------+
 | id   | flattened_numbers |
 +------+-------------------+
 |    1 |                 0 |
 |    1 |                 1 |
 |    1 |                 1 |
 |    1 |                 2 |
 |    1 |                 3 |
 |    1 |                 5 |
 |    2 |                 2 |
 |    2 |                 4 |
 |    2 |                 8 |
 |    2 |                16 |
 |    2 |                32 |
 |    3 |                 5 |
 |    3 |                10 |
 +------+-------------------*/
```

Note that for correlated joins the `  UNNEST  ` operator is optional and the `  INNER JOIN  ` can be expressed as a `  CROSS JOIN  ` or a comma cross join. Using the comma cross join shorthand notation, the previous example is consolidated as follows:

``` text
WITH
  Sequences AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id, [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
    UNION ALL SELECT 2 AS id, [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
    UNION ALL SELECT 3 AS id, [5, 10] AS some_numbers
  )
SELECT id, flattened_numbers
FROM Sequences, Sequences.some_numbers AS flattened_numbers;

/*------+-------------------+
 | id   | flattened_numbers |
 +------+-------------------+
 |    1 |                 0 |
 |    1 |                 1 |
 |    1 |                 1 |
 |    1 |                 2 |
 |    1 |                 3 |
 |    1 |                 5 |
 |    2 |                 2 |
 |    2 |                 4 |
 |    2 |                 8 |
 |    2 |                16 |
 |    2 |                32 |
 |    3 |                 5 |
 |    3 |                10 |
 +------+-------------------*/
```

## Querying nested arrays

If a table contains an `  ARRAY  ` of `  STRUCT  ` s, you can [flatten the `  ARRAY  `](#flattening_arrays) to query the fields of the `  STRUCT  ` . You can also flatten `  ARRAY  ` type fields of `  STRUCT  ` values.

### Querying `     STRUCT    ` elements in an array

The following example uses `  UNNEST  ` with `  INNER JOIN  ` to flatten an `  ARRAY  ` of `  STRUCT  ` s.

``` text
WITH
  Races AS (
    SELECT
      "800M" AS race,
      [
        STRUCT("Rudisha" AS name, [23.4, 26.3, 26.4, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Makhloufi" AS name, [24.5, 25.4, 26.6, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Murphy" AS name, [23.9, 26.0, 27.0, 26.0] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Bosse" AS name, [23.6, 26.2, 26.5, 27.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Rotich" AS name, [24.7, 25.6, 26.9, 26.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Lewandowski" AS name, [25.0, 25.7, 26.3, 27.2] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Kipketer" AS name, [23.2, 26.1, 27.3, 29.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Berian" AS name, [23.7, 26.1, 27.0, 29.3] AS laps)
      ] AS participants
    )
SELECT
  race,
  participant
FROM Races AS r
INNER JOIN UNNEST(r.participants) AS participant;

/*------+---------------------------------------+
 | race | participant                           |
 +------+---------------------------------------+
 | 800M | {Rudisha, [23.4, 26.3, 26.4, 26.1]}   |
 | 800M | {Makhloufi, [24.5, 25.4, 26.6, 26.1]} |
 | 800M | {Murphy, [23.9, 26, 27, 26]}          |
 | 800M | {Bosse, [23.6, 26.2, 26.5, 27.1]}     |
 | 800M | {Rotich, [24.7, 25.6, 26.9, 26.4]}    |
 | 800M | {Lewandowski, [25, 25.7, 26.3, 27.2]} |
 | 800M | {Kipketer, [23.2, 26.1, 27.3, 29.4]}  |
 | 800M | {Berian, [23.7, 26.1, 27, 29.3]}      |
 +------+---------------------------------------*/
```

You can find specific information from repeated fields. For example, the following query returns the fastest racer in an 800M race.

**Note:** This example doesn't involve flattening an array, but does represent a common way to get information from a repeated field.

**Example**

``` text
WITH
  Races AS (
    SELECT
      "800M" AS race,
      [
        STRUCT("Rudisha" AS name, [23.4, 26.3, 26.4, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Makhloufi" AS name, [24.5, 25.4, 26.6, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Murphy" AS name, [23.9, 26.0, 27.0, 26.0] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Bosse" AS name, [23.6, 26.2, 26.5, 27.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Rotich" AS name, [24.7, 25.6, 26.9, 26.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Lewandowski" AS name, [25.0, 25.7, 26.3, 27.2] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Kipketer" AS name, [23.2, 26.1, 27.3, 29.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Berian" AS name, [23.7, 26.1, 27.0, 29.3] AS laps)
      ] AS participants
  )
SELECT
  race,
  (
    SELECT name
    FROM UNNEST(participants)
    ORDER BY (SELECT SUM(duration) FROM UNNEST(laps) AS duration) ASC
    LIMIT 1
  ) AS fastest_racer
FROM Races;

/*------+---------------+
 | race | fastest_racer |
 +------+---------------+
 | 800M | Rudisha       |
 +------+---------------*/
```

### Querying `     ARRAY    ` -type fields in a struct

You can also get information from nested repeated fields. For example, the following statement returns the runner who had the fastest lap in an 800M race.

``` text
WITH
  Races AS (
    SELECT
      "800M" AS race,
      [
        STRUCT("Rudisha" AS name, [23.4, 26.3, 26.4, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Makhloufi" AS name, [24.5, 25.4, 26.6, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Murphy" AS name, [23.9, 26.0, 27.0, 26.0] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Bosse" AS name, [23.6, 26.2, 26.5, 27.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Rotich" AS name, [24.7, 25.6, 26.9, 26.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Lewandowski" AS name, [25.0, 25.7, 26.3, 27.2] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Kipketer" AS name, [23.2, 26.1, 27.3, 29.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Berian" AS name, [23.7, 26.1, 27.0, 29.3] AS laps)
      ]AS participants
  )
SELECT
  race,
  (
    SELECT name
    FROM UNNEST(participants), UNNEST(laps) AS duration
    ORDER BY duration ASC
    LIMIT 1
  ) AS runner_with_fastest_lap
FROM Races;

/*------+-------------------------+
 | race | runner_with_fastest_lap |
 +------+-------------------------+
 | 800M | Kipketer                |
 +------+-------------------------*/
```

Notice that the preceding query uses the comma operator ( `  ,  ` ) to perform a cross join and flatten the array. This is equivalent to using an explicit `  CROSS JOIN  ` , or the following example which uses an explicit `  INNER JOIN  ` :

``` text
WITH
  Races AS (
    SELECT "800M" AS race,
      [
        STRUCT("Rudisha" AS name, [23.4, 26.3, 26.4, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Makhloufi" AS name, [24.5, 25.4, 26.6, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Murphy" AS name, [23.9, 26.0, 27.0, 26.0] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Bosse" AS name, [23.6, 26.2, 26.5, 27.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Rotich" AS name, [24.7, 25.6, 26.9, 26.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Lewandowski" AS name, [25.0, 25.7, 26.3, 27.2] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Kipketer" AS name, [23.2, 26.1, 27.3, 29.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Berian" AS name, [23.7, 26.1, 27.0, 29.3] AS laps)
      ] AS participants
  )
SELECT
  race,
  (
    SELECT name
    FROM UNNEST(participants)
    INNER JOIN UNNEST(laps) AS duration
    ORDER BY duration ASC LIMIT 1
  ) AS runner_with_fastest_lap
FROM Races;

/*------+-------------------------+
 | race | runner_with_fastest_lap |
 +------+-------------------------+
 | 800M | Kipketer                |
 +------+-------------------------*/
```

Flattening arrays with `  INNER JOIN  ` excludes rows that have empty or `  NULL  ` arrays. If you want to include these rows, use `  LEFT JOIN  ` .

``` text
WITH
  Races AS (
    SELECT
      "800M" AS race,
      [
        STRUCT("Rudisha" AS name, [23.4, 26.3, 26.4, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Makhloufi" AS name, [24.5, 25.4, 26.6, 26.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Murphy" AS name, [23.9, 26.0, 27.0, 26.0] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Bosse" AS name, [23.6, 26.2, 26.5, 27.1] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Rotich" AS name, [24.7, 25.6, 26.9, 26.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Lewandowski" AS name, [25.0, 25.7, 26.3, 27.2] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Kipketer" AS name, [23.2, 26.1, 27.3, 29.4] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Berian" AS name, [23.7, 26.1, 27.0, 29.3] AS laps),
        STRUCT("Nathan" AS name, ARRAY<FLOAT64>[] AS laps),
        STRUCT("David" AS name, NULL AS laps)
      ] AS participants
  )
SELECT
  Participant.name,
  SUM(duration) AS finish_time
FROM Races
INNER JOIN Races.participants AS Participant
LEFT JOIN Participant.laps AS duration
GROUP BY name;

/*-------------+--------------------+
 | name        | finish_time        |
 +-------------+--------------------+
 | Murphy      | 102.9              |
 | Rudisha     | 102.19999999999999 |
 | David       | NULL               |

 | Kipketer    | 106                |
 | Nathan      | NULL               |
 | Lewandowski | 104.2              |

```

## Constructing arrays

You can construct an array using array literals or array functions. To learn more about constructing arrays, see [Array type](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#constructing_an_array) .

## Creating arrays from subqueries

A common task when working with arrays is turning a subquery result into an array. In GoogleSQL, you can accomplish this using the [`  ARRAY()  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/array_functions) function.

For example, consider the following operation on the `  Sequences  ` table:

``` text
WITH Sequences AS
  (SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
  UNION ALL SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
  UNION ALL SELECT [5, 10] AS some_numbers)
SELECT some_numbers,
  ARRAY(SELECT x * 2
        FROM UNNEST(some_numbers) AS x) AS doubled
FROM Sequences;

/*--------------------+---------------------+
 | some_numbers       | doubled             |
 +--------------------+---------------------+
 | [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] | [0, 2, 2, 4, 6, 10] |
 | [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]  | [4, 8, 16, 32, 64]  |
 | [5, 10]            | [10, 20]            |
 +--------------------+---------------------*/
```

This example starts with a table named Sequences. This table contains a column, `  some_numbers  ` , of type `  ARRAY<INT64>  ` .

The query itself contains a subquery. This subquery selects each row in the `  some_numbers  ` column and uses [`  UNNEST  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unnest_operator) to return the array as a set of rows. Next, it multiplies each value by two, and then re-combines the rows back into an array using the `  ARRAY()  ` operator.

## Filtering arrays

The following example uses a `  WHERE  ` clause in the `  ARRAY()  ` operator's subquery to filter the returned rows.

**Note:** In the following examples, the resulting rows are not ordered.

``` text
WITH Sequences AS
  (SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [5, 10] AS some_numbers)
SELECT
  ARRAY(SELECT x * 2
        FROM UNNEST(some_numbers) AS x
        WHERE x < 5) AS doubled_less_than_five
FROM Sequences;

/*------------------------+
 | doubled_less_than_five |
 +------------------------+
 | [0, 2, 2, 4, 6]        |
 | [4, 8]                 |
 | []                     |
 +------------------------*/
```

Notice that the third row contains an empty array, because the elements in the corresponding original row ( `  [5, 10]  ` ) didn't meet the filter requirement of `  x < 5  ` .

You can also filter arrays by using `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` to return only unique elements within an array.

``` text
WITH Sequences AS
  (SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers)
SELECT ARRAY(SELECT DISTINCT x
             FROM UNNEST(some_numbers) AS x) AS unique_numbers
FROM Sequences;

/*-----------------+
 | unique_numbers  |
 +-----------------+
 | [0, 1, 2, 3, 5] |
 +-----------------*/
```

You can also filter rows of arrays by using the [`  IN  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#in_operators) keyword. This keyword filters rows containing arrays by determining if a specific value matches an element in the array.

``` text
WITH Sequences AS
  (SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [5, 10] AS some_numbers)
SELECT
   ARRAY(SELECT x
         FROM UNNEST(some_numbers) AS x
         WHERE 2 IN UNNEST(some_numbers)) AS contains_two
FROM Sequences;

/*--------------------+
 | contains_two       |
 +--------------------+
 | [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] |
 | [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]  |
 | []                 |
 +--------------------*/
```

Notice again that the third row contains an empty array, because the array in the corresponding original row ( `  [5, 10]  ` ) didn't contain `  2  ` .

## Scanning arrays

To check if an array contains a specific value, use the [`  IN  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#in_operators) operator with [`  UNNEST  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unnest_operator) . To check if an array contains a value matching a condition, use the [`  EXISTS  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#exists_operator) operator with `  UNNEST  ` .

### Scanning for specific values

To scan an array for a specific value, use the `  IN  ` operator with `  UNNEST  ` .

**Example**

The following example returns `  true  ` if the array contains the number 2.

``` text
SELECT 2 IN UNNEST([0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]) AS contains_value;

/*----------------+
 | contains_value |
 +----------------+
 | true           |
 +----------------*/
```

To return the rows of a table where the array column contains a specific value, filter the results of `  IN UNNEST  ` using the `  WHERE  ` clause.

**Example**

The following example returns the `  id  ` value for the rows where the array column contains the value 2.

``` text
WITH Sequences AS
  (SELECT 1 AS id, [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT 2 AS id, [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT 3 AS id, [5, 10] AS some_numbers)
SELECT id AS matching_rows
FROM Sequences
WHERE 2 IN UNNEST(Sequences.some_numbers)
ORDER BY matching_rows;

/*---------------+
 | matching_rows |
 +---------------+
 | 1             |
 | 2             |
 +---------------*/
```

### Scanning for values that satisfy a condition

To scan an array for values that match a condition, use `  UNNEST  ` to return a table of the elements in the array, use `  WHERE  ` to filter the resulting table in a subquery, and use `  EXISTS  ` to check if the filtered table contains any rows.

**Example**

The following example returns the `  id  ` value for the rows where the array column contains values greater than 5.

``` text
WITH
  Sequences AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id, [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 AS id, [5, 10] AS some_numbers
  )
SELECT id AS matching_rows
FROM Sequences
WHERE EXISTS(SELECT * FROM UNNEST(some_numbers) AS x WHERE x > 5);

/*---------------+
 | matching_rows |
 +---------------+
 | 2             |
 | 3             |
 +---------------*/
```

#### Scanning for `     STRUCT    ` field values that satisfy a condition

To search an array of `  STRUCT  ` values for a field whose value matches a condition, use `  UNNEST  ` to return a table with a column for each `  STRUCT  ` field, then filter non-matching rows from the table using `  WHERE EXISTS  ` .

**Example**

The following example returns the rows where the array column contains a `  STRUCT  ` whose field `  b  ` has a value greater than 3.

``` text
WITH
  Sequences AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id, [STRUCT(0 AS a, 1 AS b)] AS some_numbers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, [STRUCT(2 AS a, 4 AS b)] AS some_numbers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 AS id, [STRUCT(5 AS a, 3 AS b), STRUCT(7 AS a, 4 AS b)] AS some_numbers
  )
SELECT id AS matching_rows
FROM Sequences
WHERE EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM UNNEST(some_numbers) WHERE b > 3);

/*---------------+
 | matching_rows |
 +---------------+
 | 2             |
 | 3             |
 +---------------*/
```

## Arrays and aggregation

With GoogleSQL, you can aggregate values into an array using `  ARRAY_AGG()  ` .

``` text
WITH Fruits AS
  (SELECT "apple" AS fruit
   UNION ALL SELECT "pear" AS fruit
   UNION ALL SELECT "banana" AS fruit)
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(fruit) AS fruit_basket
FROM Fruits;

/*-----------------------+
 | fruit_basket          |
 +-----------------------+
 | [apple, pear, banana] |
 +-----------------------*/
```

The array returned by `  ARRAY_AGG()  ` is in an arbitrary order, since the order in which the function concatenates values isn't guaranteed. To order the array elements, use `  ORDER BY  ` . For example:

``` text
WITH Fruits AS
  (SELECT "apple" AS fruit
   UNION ALL SELECT "pear" AS fruit
   UNION ALL SELECT "banana" AS fruit)
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(fruit ORDER BY fruit) AS fruit_basket
FROM Fruits;

/*-----------------------+
 | fruit_basket          |
 +-----------------------+
 | [apple, banana, pear] |
 +-----------------------*/
```

You can also apply aggregate functions such as `  SUM()  ` to the elements in an array. For example, the following query returns the sum of array elements for each row of the `  Sequences  ` table.

``` text
WITH Sequences AS
  (SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [5, 10] AS some_numbers)
SELECT some_numbers,
  (SELECT SUM(x)
   FROM UNNEST(s.some_numbers) AS x) AS sums
FROM Sequences AS s;

/*--------------------+------+
 | some_numbers       | sums |
 +--------------------+------+
 | [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] | 12   |
 | [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]  | 62   |
 | [5, 10]            | 15   |
 +--------------------+------*/
```

GoogleSQL also supports an aggregate function, `  ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG()  ` , which concatenates the elements of an array column across rows.

``` text
WITH Aggregates AS
  (SELECT [1,2] AS numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [3,4] AS numbers
   UNION ALL SELECT [5, 6] AS numbers)
SELECT ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG(numbers) AS count_to_six_agg
FROM Aggregates;

/*--------------------------------------------------+
 | count_to_six_agg                                 |
 +--------------------------------------------------+
 | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]                               |
 +--------------------------------------------------*/
```

**Note:** The array returned by `  ARRAY_CONCAT_AGG()  ` is non-deterministic, since the order in which the function concatenates values is not guaranteed.

## Converting arrays to strings

The `  ARRAY_TO_STRING()  ` function allows you to convert an `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` to a single `  STRING  ` value or an `  ARRAY<BYTES>  ` to a single `  BYTES  ` value where the resulting value is the ordered concatenation of the array elements.

The second argument is the separator that the function will insert between inputs to produce the output; this second argument must be of the same type as the elements of the first argument.

Example:

``` text
WITH Words AS
  (SELECT ["Hello", "World"] AS greeting)
SELECT ARRAY_TO_STRING(greeting, " ") AS greetings
FROM Words;

/*-------------+
 | greetings   |
 +-------------+
 | Hello World |
 +-------------*/
```

The optional third argument takes the place of `  NULL  ` values in the input array.

  - If you omit this argument, then the function ignores `  NULL  ` array elements.

  - If you provide an empty string, the function inserts a separator for `  NULL  ` array elements.

Example:

``` text
SELECT
  ARRAY_TO_STRING(arr, ".", "N") AS non_empty_string,
  ARRAY_TO_STRING(arr, ".", "") AS empty_string,
  ARRAY_TO_STRING(arr, ".") AS omitted
FROM (SELECT ["a", NULL, "b", NULL, "c", NULL] AS arr);

/*------------------+--------------+---------+
 | non_empty_string | empty_string | omitted |
 +------------------+--------------+---------+
 | a.N.b.N.c.N      | a..b..c.     | a.b.c   |
 +------------------+--------------+---------*/
```

## Combining arrays

In some cases, you might want to combine multiple arrays into a single array. You can accomplish this using the `  ARRAY_CONCAT()  ` function.

``` text
SELECT ARRAY_CONCAT([1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]) AS count_to_six;

/*--------------------------------------------------+
 | count_to_six                                     |
 +--------------------------------------------------+
 | [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]                               |
 +--------------------------------------------------*/
```

## Updating arrays

Consider the following table called `  arrays_table  ` . The first column in the table is an array of integers and the second column contains two nested arrays of integers.

``` text
WITH arrays_table AS (
  SELECT
    [1, 2] AS regular_array,
    STRUCT([10, 20] AS first_array, [100, 200] AS second_array) AS nested_arrays
  UNION ALL SELECT
    [3, 4] AS regular_array,
    STRUCT([30, 40] AS first_array, [300, 400] AS second_array) AS nested_arrays
)
SELECT * FROM arrays_table;

/*---------------*---------------------------*----------------------------+
 | regular_array | nested_arrays.first_array | nested_arrays.second_array |
 +---------------+---------------------------+----------------------------+
 | [1, 2]        | [10, 20]                  | [100, 200]                 |
 | [3, 4]        | [30, 40]                  | [130, 400]                 |
 +---------------*---------------------------*----------------------------*/
```

You can update arrays in a table by using the `  UPDATE  ` statement. The following example inserts the number 5 into the `  regular_array  ` column, and inserts the elements from the `  first_array  ` field of the `  nested_arrays  ` column into the `  second_array  ` field:

``` text
UPDATE
  arrays_table
SET
  regular_array = ARRAY_CONCAT(regular_array, [5]),
  nested_arrays.second_array = ARRAY_CONCAT(nested_arrays.second_array,
                                            nested_arrays.first_array)
WHERE TRUE;
SELECT * FROM arrays_table;

/*---------------*---------------------------*----------------------------+
 | regular_array | nested_arrays.first_array | nested_arrays.second_array |
 +---------------+---------------------------+----------------------------+
 | [1, 2, 5]     | [10, 20]                  | [100, 200, 10, 20]         |
 | [3, 4, 5]     | [30, 40]                  | [130, 400, 30, 40]         |
 +---------------*---------------------------*----------------------------*/
```

## Zipping arrays

Given two arrays of equal size, you can merge them into a single array consisting of pairs of elements from input arrays, taken from their corresponding positions. This operation is sometimes called [zipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_\(computer_science\)) .

You can zip arrays with `  UNNEST  ` and `  WITH OFFSET  ` . In this example, each value pair is stored as a `  STRUCT  ` in an array.

``` text
WITH
  Combinations AS (
    SELECT
      ['a', 'b'] AS letters,
      [1, 2, 3] AS numbers
  )
SELECT
  ARRAY(
    SELECT AS STRUCT
      letters[SAFE_OFFSET(index)] AS letter,
      numbers[SAFE_OFFSET(index)] AS number
    FROM Combinations
    INNER JOIN
      UNNEST(
        GENERATE_ARRAY(
          0,
          LEAST(ARRAY_LENGTH(letters), ARRAY_LENGTH(numbers)) - 1)) AS index
    ORDER BY index
  ) AS pairs;

/*------------------------------+
 | pairs                        |
 +------------------------------+
 | [{ letter: "a", number: 1 }, |
 |  { letter: "b", number: 2 }] |
 +------------------------------*/
```

You can use input arrays of different lengths as long as the first array is equal to or less than the length of the second array. The zipped array will be the length of the shortest input array.

To get a zipped array that includes all the elements even when the input arrays are different lengths, change `  LEAST  ` to `  GREATEST  ` . Elements of either array that have no associated element in the other array will be paired with `  NULL  ` .

``` text
WITH
  Combinations AS (
    SELECT
      ['a', 'b'] AS letters,
      [1, 2, 3] AS numbers
  )
SELECT
  ARRAY(
    SELECT AS STRUCT
      letters[SAFE_OFFSET(index)] AS letter,
      numbers[SAFE_OFFSET(index)] AS number
    FROM Combinations
    INNER JOIN
      UNNEST(
        GENERATE_ARRAY(
          0,
          GREATEST(ARRAY_LENGTH(letters), ARRAY_LENGTH(numbers)) - 1)) AS index
    ORDER BY index
  ) AS pairs;

/*-------------------------------+
 | pairs                         |
 +-------------------------------+
 | [{ letter: "a", number: 1 },  |
 |  { letter: "b", number: 2 },  |
 |  { letter: null, number: 3 }] |
 +-------------------------------*/
```

## Building arrays of arrays

GoogleSQL doesn't support building [arrays of arrays](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#array_type) directly. Instead, you must create an array of structs, with each struct containing a field of type `  ARRAY  ` . To illustrate this, consider the following `  Points  ` table:

``` text
/*----------+
 | point    |
 +----------+
 | [1, 5]   |
 | [2, 8]   |
 | [3, 7]   |
 | [4, 1]   |
 | [5, 7]   |
 +----------*/
```

Now, let's say you wanted to create an array consisting of each `  point  ` in the `  Points  ` table. To accomplish this, wrap the array returned from each row in a `  STRUCT  ` , as shown below.

``` text
WITH Points AS
  (SELECT [1, 5] AS point
   UNION ALL SELECT [2, 8] AS point
   UNION ALL SELECT [3, 7] AS point
   UNION ALL SELECT [4, 1] AS point
   UNION ALL SELECT [5, 7] AS point)
SELECT ARRAY(
  SELECT STRUCT(point)
  FROM Points)
  AS coordinates;

/*-------------------+
 | coordinates       |
 +-------------------+
 | [{point: [1,5]},  |
 |  {point: [2,8]},  |
 |  {point: [5,7]},  |
 |  {point: [3,7]},  |
 |  {point: [4,1]}]  |
 +-------------------*/
```
