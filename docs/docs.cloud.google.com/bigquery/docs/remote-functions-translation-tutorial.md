## Before you begin

We recommend that you create a Google Cloud project for this tutorial. Also, make sure that you have the required roles to complete this tutorial.

### Set up a Google Cloud project

To set up a Google Cloud project for this tutorial, complete these steps:

### Required roles for your account

To get the permissions that you need to perform the tasks in this tutorial, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your project:

  - [BigQuery Data Owner](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataOwner) ( `  roles/bigquery.dataOwner  ` )
  - [BigQuery Connection Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.connectionAdmin) ( `  roles/bigquery.connectionAdmin  ` )
  - [Cloud Functions Developer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudfunctions#cloudfunctions.developer) ( `  roles/cloudfunctions.developer  ` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to perform the tasks in this tutorial. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to perform the tasks in this tutorial:

  - `  bigquery.datasets.create  `
  - `  bigquery.connections.create  `
  - `  bigquery.connections.get  `
  - `  cloudfunctions.functions.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

### Required roles for the Compute Engine default service account

When you enabled the API for Cloud Run functions, a [Compute Engine default service account](/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account) was created. To complete this tutorial, you must give this default service account the Cloud Translation API User role.

1.  [Get the ID assigned to the project](/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects) .

2.  Copy your Compute Engine default service account. Your default service account looks like this:
    
    ``` text
    PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
    ```
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_NUMBER  ` with your project ID.

3.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page.

4.  Select your project.

5.  Click person\_add **Grant access** , and then in the **New principals** field, paste the Compute Engine default service account that you copied earlier.

6.  In the **Assign roles** list, search for and select **Cloud Translation API User** .

7.  Click **Save** .

## Create a Cloud Run functions function

Using Cloud Run functions, create a function that translates input text into Spanish.

1.  [Create a Cloud Run functions function](/functions/docs/console-quickstart#create_a_function) with the following specifications:
    
      - For **Environment** , select **2nd gen** .
    
      - For **Function name** , enter `  translation-handler  ` .
    
      - For **Region** , select **us-central1** .
    
      - For **Maximum number of instances** , enter `  10  ` .
        
        This setting is in the **Runtime, build, connections and security settings** section.
        
        In this tutorial, we use a lower value than the default to control the request rate sent to Translation.
    
      - For **Runtime** , select **Python 3.10** .
    
      - For **Entry point** , enter `  handle_translation  ` .

2.  In the file list, select **main.py** , and then paste the following code.
    
    Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Python API reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest) .
    
    To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

    ```
    
    Update `  <your location>  ` with `  us-central1  ` .

3.  In the file list, select **requirements.txt** , and then paste the following text:
    
    ``` text
    Flask==2.2.2
    functions-framework==3.9.2
    google-cloud-translate==3.18.0
    Werkzeug==2.3.8
    ```

4.  Click **Deploy** and wait for the function to deploy.

5.  Click the **Trigger** tab.

6.  Copy the **Trigger URL** value and save it for later. You must use this URL when you create a BigQuery remote function.

## Create a BigQuery dataset

[Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets#create-dataset) that will contain the remote function. When you create the dataset, include these specifications:

  - For **Dataset ID** , enter `  remote_function_test  ` .
  - For **Location type** , select **Multi-region** .
  - For **Multi-region** , select **US (multiple regions in United States)** .

## Create a BigQuery connection and service account

Create a BigQuery connection so that you can implement a remote function with any supported languages in Cloud Run functions and Cloud Run. When you create a connection, a service account is created for that connection.

1.  [Create a Google Cloud resource connection](/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection#create-cloud-resource-connection) with the following specifications:
    
      - For **Connection type** , select **BigLake and remote functions (Cloud Resource)**
      - For **Connection ID** , enter `  remote-function-connection  ` .
      - For **Location type** , select **Multi-region** .
      - For **Multi-region** , select **US (multiple regions in United States)** .

2.  [Open the **Connections** list](/bigquery/docs/working-with-connections#list-connections) and select **`  us.remote-function-connection  `** .

3.  Copy the service account ID and save it for later. You must grant permissions to this ID in the next step.

## Grant permissions to the BigQuery service account

The service account that you created in the previous step needs permission to use Cloud Run so that the BigQuery remote function can use the Cloud Run functions function. To grant permissions to the service account, complete the following steps:

1.  Go to the **Cloud Run** page.

2.  Select your project.

3.  Select the checkbox next to **`  translation-handler  `** .

4.  In the **Permissions** panel, click **Add principal** .

5.  In the **New principals** field, enter the service account ID that you copied earlier.

6.  In the **Assign roles** list, search for and select **Cloud Run Invoker** .

7.  Click **Save** .

**Note:** It can take up to a minute before new permissions take effect.

## Create a BigQuery remote function

To use the Cloud Run functions function that translates text into Spanish with a BigQuery remote function, complete the following steps.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following query:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION `remote_function_test.translate_text`(x STRING)
    RETURNS
    STRING
        REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `us.remote-function-connection`
    OPTIONS (
        endpoint = 'TRIGGER_URL',
        max_batching_rows = 10);
    ```
    
    Replace `  TRIGGER_URL  ` with the trigger URL that you saved earlier when you created a Cloud Run functions function.

3.  Click **Run** . A message similar to the following is displayed:
    
    ``` console
    This statement created a new function named
    your_project.remote_function_test.translate_text.
    ```

**Note:** To limit how many rows are included in an HTTP request, the `  max_batching_rows  ` option is set to `  10  ` . When you do not specify the `  max_batching_rows  ` option, BigQuery decides how many rows are included in an HTTP request.

## Call the BigQuery remote function

After you create your remote function, test it to make sure that it is linked to the Cloud Run functions function and produces the expected results in Spanish.

1.  In the BigQuery query editor, enter the following query, and then click **Run** .
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      remote_function_test.translate_text('This new feature is fantastic!')
        AS translated_text;
    ```
    
    The results are similar to the following:
    
    ``` console
    +-------------------------------------------+
    | translated_text                           |
    +-------------------------------------------+
    | ¡Esta nueva característica es fantástica! |
    +-------------------------------------------+
    ```

2.  Optional: To test the remote function on a public dataset, enter the following query, and then click **Run** . To limit the results returned, use the `  LIMIT  ` clause.
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
        text,
        remote_function_test.translate_text(text) AS translated_text
    FROM
        (SELECT text FROM `bigquery-public-data.hacker_news.full` LIMIT 3);
    ```
    
    The results are similar to the following:
    
    ``` console
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | text                            | translated_text                         |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | These benchmarks look good.     | Estos puntos de referencia se ven bien. |
    | Who is using Java?              | ¿Quién está usando Java?                |
    | You need more database storage. | Necesitas más almacenamiento.           |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    ```

## Delete the resources

If you don't plan to use these functions in this project, you can avoid additional costs by deleting your project. This permanently deletes all resources associated with the project.

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `  appspot.com  ` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
