# Data location and transfers

This page explains the concepts of transfer configuration location and source data location, and also describes how locations and transfers interact.

For more information about BigQuery locations more generally, see [Dataset locations](/bigquery/docs/locations) .

## Transfer location

Transfer configurations have locations. When you set up a transfer configuration, set the transfer configuration up in the same project as the destination dataset. The location of the transfer configuration is automatically set to the same location that you specified for the destination dataset. The BigQuery Data Transfer Service processes and stages data in the same location as the destination BigQuery dataset. If you don't have a destination dataset when you create the transfer, you must create one in BigQuery before configuring the transfer.

## Source data location

The source data you want to transfer to BigQuery might have a location. However, the location where your source data is stored and the location of the destination dataset in BigQuery are irrelevant.

## Location considerations for data warehouse migrations

Data warehouse migrations from [Teradata](/bigquery/docs/migration/teradata-overview) require a Cloud Storage bucket as part of the transfer process. The Cloud Storage bucket must be colocated with the BigQuery destination dataset.

Redshift data warehouse migrations do not require a colocated Cloud Storage bucket.

**Key Point:** You can copy a dataset or manually move it to another location. See [Managing datasets](/bigquery/docs/managing-datasets) for details. For more information about using Cloud Storage to store and move large datasets, see [Using Cloud Storage with big data](/storage/docs/working-with-big-data) .
