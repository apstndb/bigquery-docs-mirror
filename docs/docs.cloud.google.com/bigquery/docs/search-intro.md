# Introduction to search in BigQuery

**Note:** This feature may not be available when using reservations that are created with certain BigQuery editions. For more information about which features are enabled in each edition, see [Introduction to BigQuery editions](/bigquery/docs/editions-intro) .

BigQuery search indexes let you use GoogleSQL to efficiently find unique data elements that are buried in unstructured text and semi-structured JSON data, without having to know the table schemas in advance.

With search indexes, BigQuery provides a powerful columnar store and text search in one platform, enabling efficient row lookups when you need to find individual rows of data. A common use case is log analytics. For example, you might want to identify the rows of data associated with a user for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) reporting, or to find specific error codes in a text payload.

BigQuery stores and manages your indexes, so that when data becomes available in BigQuery, you can immediately retrieve it with the [`  SEARCH  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/search_functions#search) or [other operators and functions](/bigquery/docs/search#operator_and_function_optimization) , such as the equal ( `  =  ` ), `  IN  ` , or `  LIKE  ` operators and certain string and JSON functions. To optimize your searches, read about [best practices](/bigquery/docs/search#best_practices) .

**Important:** Join the [Search discussion group](https://groups.google.com/g/bq-search) to post questions and comments, and to follow the latest updates.

## Use cases

BigQuery search indexes help you perform the following tasks:

  - Search system, network, or application logs stored in BigQuery tables.
  - Identify data elements for deletion to comply with regulatory processes.
  - Support developer troubleshooting.
  - Perform security audits.
  - Create a dashboard that requires highly selective search filters.
  - Search pre-processed data for exact matches.

For more information, see [Create a search index](/bigquery/docs/search-index) and [Search with an index](/bigquery/docs/search) .

## Pricing

There is no charge for the processing required to build and refresh your search indexes when the total size of indexed tables in your organization is below your region's [limit](/bigquery/quotas#index_limits) . To support indexing beyond this limit, you need to [provide your own reservation](/bigquery/docs/search-index#use_your_own_reservation) for handling the index-management jobs. Search indexes incur storage costs when they are active. You can find the index storage size in the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-indexes) .

## Roles and permissions

To create a search index, you need the [`  bigquery.tables.createIndex  ` IAM permission](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bq-permissions) on the table where you're creating the index. To drop a search index, you need the `  bigquery.tables.deleteIndex  ` permission. Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need to work with search indexes:

  - BigQuery Data Owner ( `  roles/bigquery.dataOwner  ` )
  - BigQuery Data Editor ( `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` )
  - BigQuery Admin ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` )

## Limitations

  - You can't create a search index directly on a view or materialized view, but calling the [`  SEARCH  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/search_functions#search) on a view of an indexed table makes use of the underlying search index.

  - You can't create a search index on an external table.

  - If you rename a table after you create a search index on it, the index becomes invalid.

  - The `  SEARCH  ` function is designed for point lookups. Fuzzy searching, typo correction, wildcards, and other types of document searches are not available.

  - If the search index is not yet at 100% coverage, you are still charged for all index storage that is reported in the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SEARCH_INDEXES  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-indexes) .

  - Queries that use the `  SEARCH  ` function or are optimized by search indexes are not accelerated by [BigQuery BI Engine](/bigquery/docs/bi-engine-intro) .

  - Search indexes are not used when the indexed table is modified by a DML statement, but they can be used when the predicate that is optimizable by search indexes is part of a subquery in a DML statement.
    
      - A search index is not used in the following query:
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    DELETE FROM my_dataset.indexed_table
    WHERE SEARCH(user_id, '123');
    ```
    
      - A search index can be used in the following query:
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    DELETE FROM my_dataset.other_table
    WHERE
      user_id IN (
        SELECT user_id
        FROM my_dataset.indexed_table
        WHERE SEARCH(user_id, '123')
      );
    ```

  - Search indexes are not used when the query references [Materialized Views](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro) .

  - Search indexes are not used in a [multi-statement transaction query](/bigquery/docs/transactions) .

  - Search indexes are not used in a [time-travel query](/bigquery/docs/time-travel) .
