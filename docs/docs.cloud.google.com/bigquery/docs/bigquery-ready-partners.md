# Google Cloud Ready - BigQuery Partners

The BigQuery Validation Program lets partners validate their integrations into BigQuery to ensure the best integration possible. Our BigQuery Validation Program has three phases:

  - **Evaluate:** Google teams run a series of data integration tests in a sandboxed production environment and compare results against best practices and performance benchmarks.
  - **Enhance:** We take the results from the Evaluate phase and work with our partners to fill in the gaps, if any.
  - **Enable:** Together with our partners, we refine existing documentation to make sure our mutual customers have everything they need to successfully work with our products.

This document lists the partner solutions that have been validated as part of the [**Google Cloud Ready - BigQuery** program](/bigquery/docs/bigquery-ready-overview) . Third-party software is not supported by Cloud Customer Care when it has been identified that BigQuery is working as intended. These solutions are organized by the following categories:

  - [BI, ML, & Advanced Analytics](#bi-ml-analytics)
  - [Connectors & Developer Tools](#connectors-developer-tools)
  - [Data Governance, Security, & MDM](#data-governance-mdm)
  - [Data Quality, Observability, & FinOps](#data-quality-observability)
  - [ETL & Data Integration](#etl-data-integration)

Stitch is a cloud-first, open source platform for rapidly moving data. A simple, powerful ETL service, Stitch connects to all your data sources–from databases like MySQL.

Stitch's goal is to get data from your data sources to your destination in a useful, raw format. *Useful* means with types and structures that make the data easy to work with, and *raw* means staying as close to the original representation as possible. This doesn't mean that Stitch doesn't perform transformations during the replication process. Stitch just doesn't perform arbitrary transformations: Stitch will perform only the transformations required to ensure the loaded data is useful and compatible with your destination. The transformations Stitch performs are dependent on the destination you choose.
