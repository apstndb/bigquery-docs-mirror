# Monitor BigQuery reservations

As a BigQuery administrator, you can monitor reservations in your project by viewing the project and reservation slot usage and also view your capacity-based bill.

## View project and reservation slot usage

You can view the project and reservation slot usage in the following ways:

  - **`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` views.** To retrieve project and reservation usage information, query the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS*  ` views](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs#examples) .
    
    The [`  reservation_id  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs#schema) field in the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS*  ` views contains the reservation name.

  - **Google Cloud console.** The Google Cloud console includes charts that display slot usage. For more information, see [Use administrative resource charts](/bigquery/docs/admin-resource-charts) .

  - **Audit logs.** Use [audit logs](/bigquery/docs/reference/auditlogs) to view metrics about slot usage.

  - **The `  Jobs  ` method.** Use the [`  Jobs  ` API method](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs) to view metrics about slot usage for a job.

  - **Cloud Monitoring.** You can use [Cloud Monitoring](/bigquery/docs/monitoring-dashboard) to create dashboards to monitor your allocated slots. With a Cloud Monitoring dashboard, you can view your slot usage for each reservation and for each job type, across all projects within the reservation. For more information about the metrics available for the Cloud Monitoring dashboard, see [Metrics available for visualization](/bigquery/docs/monitoring-dashboard#metrics) .

**Note:** The number of slots in use might appear higher than your reservation slot count because of how BigQuery provisions resources to reservations. You are not charged for slots beyond your reservation slot count.

## View your capacity-based bill

To view your capacity-based bill in real time, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Billing** page.
    
    .

2.  Select the billing account project for which you want to view the bill.

3.  Navigate to the **Reports** section and then in the **Filters** section, do the following:
    
    1.  From the **Services** list, select **BigQuery** and select all that's applicable.
    2.  Select **All SKUs** from the **SKUs** list.

**Note:** BigQuery annual and three-year commitments are priced by months. Your bill doesn't change due to variability in the month length. If your slot usage remains unchanged, the rate remains the same every month.

## Reservation cost attribution

This feature lets you attribute reservation fees back to the specific query usage across any projects that used the reservation. This results in more accurate net costs for each project basis.

All [BigQuery Reservations API](/bigquery/docs/reservations-commitments#enabling-reservations-api) customers have an **"Analysis Slots Attribution"** line item in their Cloud Billing data. This line item is included on the **Billing** page and in the Cloud Billing export.

This line item shows slot hours used per project. It incurs no cost and doesn't affect your invoice totals.

## Audit logs

Creating, deleting, and updating resources related to [BigQuery reservations](/bigquery/docs/reservations-concepts) are recorded in the project owner's audit logs. For more information, see [Audit log](/bigquery/docs/reference/auditlogs#auditlog_format) .

## Monitor autoscaling with information schema

You can use the following SQL scripts to check the billed slot seconds for a particular edition. You must run these scripts in the same project the reservations were created. The first script shows billed slot seconds covered by `  commitment_plan  ` while the second script shows billed slot seconds that aren't covered by a commitment.

You only need to set the value of three variables to run these scripts:

  - `  start_time  `
  - `  end_time  `
  - `  edition_to_check  `

These scripts are subject to the following caveats:

  - Deleted reservations and capacity commitments are removed from information schema views at the end of the data retention period. Specify a recent window of time which doesn't contain deleted reservations and commitments for correct results.

  - The result of the scripts may not exactly match the bill due to small rounding errors.

The following script aggregates autoscaling slots per edition.

#### Expand to see the script to calculate autoscale slot seconds per edition.

``` text
SELECT
  edition,
  SUM(s.autoscale_current_slots) AS autoscale_slot_seconds
FROM
  `region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESERVATIONS_TIMELINE` m
JOIN
  m.per_second_details s
WHERE
  period_start BETWEEN '2025-09-28'
  AND '2025-09-29'
GROUP BY
  edition
ORDER BY
  edition
```

The following script aggregates autoscaling slots per reservation.

#### Expand to see the script to calculate autoscale slot seconds per reservation.

``` text
select reservation_id, sum(s.autoscale_current_slots) as autoscale_slot_seconds
from `region-us.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESERVATIONS_TIMELINE` m
LEFT JOIN m.per_second_details s
WHERE period_start between '2025-09-28' and '2025-09-29'
group by reservation_id
order by reservation_id
```
