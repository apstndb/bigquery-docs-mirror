The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FAILOVER_HISTORY` view contains a near real-time list of failover events for reservations within the administration project that use [managed disaster recovery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/managed-disaster-recovery) . Each row represents a single failover event for a single reservation.

> **Note:** The view names `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FAILOVER_HISTORY` and `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FAILOVER_HISTORY_BY_PROJECT` are synonymous and can be used interchangeably.

## Required roles

To get the permission that you need to query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FAILOVER_HISTORY` view, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Resource Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.resourceViewer) ( `roles/bigquery.resourceViewer` ) IAM role on the project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the `bigquery.reservations.list` permission, which is required to query the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FAILOVER_HISTORY` view.

You might also be able to get this permission with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Schema

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FAILOVER_HISTORY` view has the following schema:

| Column name                 | Data type   | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `reservation_name`          | `STRING`    | User-provided reservation name. For example, if the reservation URI is `projects/my-project/locations/US/reservations/my-reservation` , then the reservation name is `my-reservation` .                                                                                                                                                      |
| `start_time`                | `TIMESTAMP` | Time when the failover was initiated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `original_primary_location` | `STRING`    | The location where the reservation was originally created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `from_location`             | `STRING`    | The primary location before the failover. This location becomes the secondary after the failover.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `to_location`               | `STRING`    | The secondary location before the failover, where the failover was initiated. This location becomes the primary after the failover.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `end_time`                  | `TIMESTAMP` | Time when the soft failover completed. `NULL` while the soft failover is in progress, and always `NULL` for the hard failover.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `failover_mode`             | `STRING`    | Type of failover. Can be `SOFT` or `HARD` . For more information, see [Managed disaster recovery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/managed-disaster-recovery) .                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `state`                     | `STRING`    | State of the failover. Can be `STARTED` (while a soft failover is in progress, or for a hard failover) or `COMPLETED` (after a soft failover finishes). For more information about the `STARTED` state for a hard failover, see [Limitations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-failover-history#limitations) . |

For stability, we recommend that you explicitly list columns in your information schema queries instead of using a wildcard ( `SELECT *` ). Explicitly listing columns prevents queries from breaking if the underlying schema changes.

## Data retention

This view keeps failover events for 180 days, after which they are removed from the view.

## Scope and syntax

Queries against this view must include a [region qualifier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#syntax) . The following table explains the region scope for this view:

| View name                                                                                               | Resource scope | Region scope |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| `[ `` PROJECT_ID ```  .]`region-  ``` REGION ```  `.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FAILOVER_HISTORY[_BY_PROJECT] `` | Project level  | `REGION`     |

Replace the following:

- Optional: `PROJECT_ID` : the ID of your Google Cloud project. If not specified, the default project is used.

- `REGION` : any [dataset region name](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations) . For example, `` `region-us` `` .

  > **Note:** You must use [a region qualifier](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro#region_qualifier) to query `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views. The location of the query execution must match the region of the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` view.

## Limitations

The following limitations apply to the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FAILOVER_HISTORY` view:

- This view only contains failover events for reservations. It doesn't contain failover events for individual datasets.

- Each failover event is recorded in the region that becomes the new primary location ( `to_location` ). For example, if you fail over a reservation from `US` to `EU` , the event is recorded in `region-eu` . To view failover events in both directions between a primary and secondary location, query the view separately in each region.

- A hard failover doesn't wait for the operation to be confirmed in the secondary location, so a hard failover event has no completion signal. The `state` column for a hard failover event remains `STARTED` , and the `end_time` column remains `NULL` , even after the failover has taken effect.

## Example

The following example retrieves the failover events in `region-us` (where `US` was the destination location `to_location` of the failover) for a specific reservation and project, ordered by the most recent event:

```
SELECT
  project_id,
  reservation_name,
  failover_mode,
  state,
  original_primary_location,
  from_location,
  to_location,
  start_time,
  end_time
FROM
  `reservation-admin-project.region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FAILOVER_HISTORY
WHERE
  reservation_name = 'my-reservation'
ORDER BY
  start_time DESC;
```

The output is similar to the following:

```
+---------------+------------------+---------------+-----------+---------------------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
|  project_id   | reservation_name | failover_mode |   state   | original_primary_location | from_location | to_location |     start_time      |      end_time       |
+---------------+------------------+---------------+-----------+---------------------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
| my-admin-proj | my-reservation   | SOFT          | COMPLETED | US                        | EU            | US          | 2026-03-15 14:20:00 | 2026-03-15 14:31:05 |
| my-admin-proj | my-reservation   | HARD          | STARTED   | US                        | EU            | US          | 2026-02-10 08:15:30 | NULL                |
+---------------+------------------+---------------+-----------+---------------------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+
```
