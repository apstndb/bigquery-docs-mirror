# Delete models

This page shows you how to delete BigQuery ML models. You can delete a model by:

  - Using the Google Cloud console
  - Using the bq command-line tool's `  bq rm  ` command or `  bq query  ` command
  - Calling the [`  models.delete  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/models/delete) API method or calling the [`  jobs.query  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query) method
  - Using the client libraries

You can only delete one model at a time. When you delete a model, any data in the model is also deleted.

To automatically delete models after a specified period of time, set the model's expiration time when you create it using the bq command-line tool, the API, or the client libraries. If you did not set the expiration when the model was created, you can [update the model's expiration time](/bigquery/docs/updating-model-metadata#expiration) .

## Limitations on deleting models

Deleting a model is subject to the following limitations:

  - You can't delete multiple models at the same time. You must delete them individually.
  - You can't restore a deleted model.

## Required permissions

To delete models in a dataset, you must be assigned the [`  WRITER  `](/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam#grant_access_to_a_dataset) role on the dataset, or you must be assigned a project-level Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that includes `  bigquery.models.delete  ` permissions. If you are granted `  bigquery.models.delete  ` permissions at the project level, you can delete models in any dataset in the project. The following project-level IAM roles include `  bigquery.models.delete  ` permissions:

  - `  bigquery.dataEditor  `
  - `  bigquery.dataOwner  `
  - `  bigquery.admin  `

For more information about IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery ML, see [Access control](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

## Delete a model

To delete a model, do the following:

### Console

You can delete a model in the Google Cloud console by using the **Delete Model** option or by running a query that contains a [`  DROP MODEL | DROP MODEL IF EXISTS  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-drop-model) DDL statement.

**Option one:** Use the **Delete Model** option.

1.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then click your dataset.

3.  Click the **Models** tab, and then click a model name to select the model.

4.  Click the options icon more\_vert for the model and then click **Delete** .

5.  In the **Delete model** dialog, type `  delete  ` and then click **Delete** .

**Option two:** Use a DDL statement.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  Click **Compose new query** .

3.  Type your DDL statement in the **Query editor** text area.
    
    ``` text
     DROP MODEL mydataset.mymodel
    ```

4.  Click **Run** . When the query completes, the model is removed from the navigation pane.

### bq

You can delete a model using the bq command-line tool by entering the:

  - `  bq rm  ` command with the `  --model  ` or `  -m  ` flag
  - `  bq query  ` command with the DDL statement as the query parameter

If you are deleting a model in a project other than your default project, add the project ID to the dataset in the following format: `  [PROJECT_ID]:[DATASET].[MODEL]  ` .

**Option one:** Enter the `  bq rm  ` command

When you use the `  bq rm  ` command to remove a model, you must confirm the action. You can use the `  --force flag  ` (or `  -f  ` shortcut) to skip confirmation.

``` text
bq rm -f --model PROJECT_ID:DATASET.MODEL
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` is your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` is the name of the dataset.
  - `  MODEL  ` is the name of the model.

The `  rm  ` command produces no output.

Examples:

Enter the following command to delete `  mymodel  ` from `  mydataset  ` . `  mydataset  ` is in your default project.

``` text
bq rm --model mydataset.mymodel
```

Enter the following command to delete `  mymodel  ` from `  mydataset  ` . `  mydataset  ` is in `  myotherproject  ` , not your default project.

``` text
bq rm --model myotherproject:mydataset.mymodel
```

Enter the following command to delete `  mymodel  ` from `  mydataset  ` . `  mydataset  ` is in your default project. The command uses the `  -f  ` shortcut to bypass confirmation.

``` text
bq rm -f --model mydataset.mymodel
```

You can confirm that the model was deleted by issuing the `  bq ls  ` command. For more information, see [List models](/bigquery/docs/listing-models) .

**Option two:** Enter the `  bq query  ` command

To delete a model by using the `  bq query  ` command, supply the `  DROP MODEL  ` statement in the query parameter and supply the `  --use_legacy_sql=false  ` flag to specify GoogleSQL query syntax.

Examples:

Enter the following command to delete `  mymodel  ` from `  mydataset  ` . `  mydataset  ` is in your default project.

``` text
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false 'DROP MODEL mydataset.mymodel'
```

Enter the following command to delete `  mymodel  ` from `  mydataset  ` . `  mydataset  ` is in `  myotherproject  ` , not your default project.

``` text
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
'DROP MODEL myotherproject:mydataset.mymodel'
```

### API

**Option one:** Call the `  models.delete  ` method

To delete a model, call the [`  models.delete  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models/delete) method and provide the `  projectId  ` , `  datasetId  ` , and `  modelId  ` .

**Option two:** Call the `  jobs.query  ` method

To delete a model, call the [`  jobs.query  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query) method and supply the `  DROP MODEL  ` DDL statement in the request body's [query](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query#queryrequest) property.
