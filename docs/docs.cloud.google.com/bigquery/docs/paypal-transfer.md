## Limitations

PayPal data transfers are subject to the following limitations:

  - There can be a delay of several hours before PayPal transactions become available through the PayPal API.
      - We recommend scheduling subsequent data transfers at longer intervals (no more than one every hour) to prevent missing data.
  - The PayPal connector only supports [transactions data](#supported_objects) from the past 3 years.
  - The PayPal connector only supports [disputes data](#supported_objects) from the past 6 months.
  - PayPal APIs use different page size limits for each data object. The PayPal connector uses the maximum page size allowed by PayPal in a data transfer.
      - However, some objects like `  Payments  ` or `  Payment Transactions  ` use smaller page size limits. This can lead to slower data transfers, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## Before you begin

The following sections describe the steps that you need to take before you create a PayPal data transfer.

### PayPal prerequisites

To enable data transfers from PayPal, you must have the following:

  - You must have a PayPal Developer account. For more information, see [PayPal Developer Program](https://developer.paypal.com/developer-program/) .
  - Create a PayPal REST API app. For more information, see [Get started with PayPal REST APIs](https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/) .
      - In the **Apps & Credentials** section, note the client ID and secret key for the app.
      - In the **Features** section, enable the **Transaction search** and **Invoicing** API permissions.

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role . For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a transfer:

  - `  bigquery.transfers.update  ` on the user
  - `  bigquery.datasets.get  ` on the target dataset
  - `  bigquery.datasets.update  ` on the target dataset

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

### BigQuery prerequisites

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store your data.
  - If you intend to set up transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, ensure that you have the `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission. Pub/Sub permissions are not required if you only set up email notifications. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

## Set up a PayPal data transfer

Add PayPal data into BigQuery by setting up a transfer configuration using one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the Data transfers page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  Click add **Create transfer** .

3.  In the **Source type** section, for **Source** , select **PayPal** .

4.  In the **Data source details** section, do the following:
    
      - For **Client Id** , enter the PayPal client ID. For more information, see [PayPal prerequisites](/bigquery/docs/paypal-transfer#paypal-prerequisites) .
      - For **Client Secret** , enter the PayPal client secret key. For more information, see [PayPal prerequisites](/bigquery/docs/paypal-transfer#paypal-prerequisites) .
      - Select **Is Sandbox** if you are using a sandbox PayPal account.
      - For **Start Date** , enter a date in the format `  YYYY-MM-DD  ` . The data transfer loads PayPal data starting from this date.
          - If this field is left blank, this transfer defaults to retrieving data from the past 3 years.
          - For information about what objects support the start date filter, see [Supported objects](/bigquery/docs/paypal-transfer#supported_objects) .
      - For **PayPal objects to transfer** , enter the names of the PayPal objects to transfer, or click **Browse** and select the objects that you want to transfer.

5.  In the **Destination settings** section, for **Dataset** , select the dataset that you created to store your data.

6.  In the **Transfer config name** section, for **Display name** , enter a name for the data transfer.

7.  In the **Schedule options** section, do the following:
    
      - In the **Repeat frequency** list, select an option to specify how often this data transfer runs. To specify a custom repeat frequency, select **Custom** . If you select **On-demand** , then this transfer runs when you [manually trigger the transfer](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .
      - If applicable, select either **Start now** or **Start at set time** , and provide a start date and run time.

8.  Optional: In the **Notification options** section, do the following:
    
      - To enable email notifications, toggle **Email notification** to the on position. When you enable this option, the transfer administrator receives an email notification when a transfer run fails.
      - To enable [Pub/Sub transfer run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) for this transfer, toggle **Pub/Sub notifications** to the on position. You can select your [topic](/pubsub/docs/overview#types) name, or you can click **Create a topic** to create one.

9.  Click **Save** .

### bq

Enter the [`  bq mk  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_mk) and supply the transfer creation flag `  --transfer_config  ` :

``` text
bq mk
    --transfer_config
    --project_id=PROJECT_ID
    --data_source=DATA_SOURCE
    --display_name=DISPLAY_NAME
    --target_dataset=DATASET
    --params='PARAMETERS'
```

Where:

  - PROJECT\_ID (optional): your Google Cloud project ID. If `  --project_id  ` isn't supplied to specify a particular project, the default project is used.

  - DATA\_SOURCE : the data source — `  paypal  ` .

  - DISPLAY\_NAME : the display name for the data transfer configuration. The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.

  - DATASET : the target dataset for the transfer configuration.

  - PARAMETERS : the parameters for the created transfer configuration in JSON format. For example: `  --params='{"param":"param_value"}'  ` . The following are the parameters for a PayPal data transfer:
    
      - `  assets  ` : a list of PayPal objects to be included in this transfer.
      - `  connector.authentication.clientId  ` : client ID of the PayPal application.
      - `  connector.authentication.clientSecret  ` : client secret of the PayPal application.
      - `  connector.isSandbox  ` : set value to `  true  ` if you are using a sandbox PayPal account, or `  false  ` if you are using a production PayPal account.
      - `  connector.createdStartDate  ` : (Optional) enter a date in the format `  YYYY-MM-DD  ` . The data transfer loads PayPal data starting from this date.

For example, the following command creates a PayPal data transfer in the default project with all the required parameters:

``` text
  bq mk \
      --transfer_config \
      --target_dataset=mydataset \
      --data_source=PayPal \
      --display_name='My Transfer' \
      --params='{"assets":  ["Payments", "TransactionReports"],
          "connector.authentication.clientId": "112233445566",
          "connector.authentication.clientSecret":"123456789",
          "connector.isSandbox":"false",
          "connector.createdStartDate":  "2025-01-01"}'
```

When you create a data transfer using the bq command-line tool, the transfer configuration schedules data transfers once every 8 hours.

**Note:** You cannot configure notifications if you set up a transfer configuration using the bq command-line tool.

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.transferConfigs.create  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create) and supply an instance of the [`  TransferConfig  ` resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs#TransferConfig) .

When you save the transfer configuration, the PayPal connector automatically triggers a transfer run according to your schedule option. With every transfer run, the PayPal connector transfers all available data from PayPal into BigQuery.

To manually run a data transfer outside of your regular schedule, you can start a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .
