# Schedule pipelines

This document describes how to schedule [BigQuery pipelines](/bigquery/docs/pipelines-introduction) , including how to schedule pipelines and inspect scheduled pipeline runs.

Pipelines are powered by [Dataform](/dataform/docs/overview) . Each pipeline schedule is run using your Google Account user credentials or a [custom service account](/dataform/docs/access-control#about-service-accounts) that you select when you configure the schedule.

Changes you make to a pipeline are automatically saved, but are available only to you and to users granted the Dataform Admin role on the project. To update the schedule with a new version of the pipeline, you need to [deploy the pipeline](#deploy) . Deploying updates the schedule to use your current version of the pipeline. Schedules always run the latest deployed version.

Schedules of pipelines that contain notebooks use a [default runtime specification](/colab/docs/runtimes#default_runtime_specifications) . During a scheduled run of a pipeline containing notebooks, BigQuery writes notebook output to the [Cloud Storage bucket](/storage/docs/buckets) selected during schedule creation.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, [create a pipeline](/bigquery/docs/create-pipelines) .

### Enable pipeline scheduling

To schedule pipelines, you must grant the following role to the custom service account that you plan to use for pipeline schedules:

  - [Service Account User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountUser) ( `  roles/iam.serviceAccountUser  ` )  
    Follow [Grant a single role on a service account](/iam/docs/manage-access-service-accounts#grant-single-role) to add your service account as a principal to itself. In other words, add the service account as a principal to the same service account. Then, grant the Service Account User role to this principal.

If your pipeline contains SQL queries, you must grant the following roles to the service account that you plan to use for pipeline schedules:

  - [BigQuery Job User](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` )  
    Follow [Grant a single role on a project](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role) to grant the BigQuery Job User role to your service account on projects from which your pipelines read data.
  - [BigQuery Data Viewer](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataViewer) ( `  roles/bigquery.dataViewer  ` )  
    Follow [Grant a single role on a project](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role) to grant the BigQuery Data Viewer role to your service account on projects from which your pipelines read data.
  - [BigQuery Data Editor](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor) ( `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` )  
    Follow [Grant a single role on a project](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role) to grant the BigQuery Data Editor role to your service account on projects to which your pipelines write data.

If your pipeline contains notebooks, you must grant the following roles to the service account that you plan to use for pipeline schedules:

  - [Notebook Executor User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/aiplatform#aiplatform.notebookExecutorUser) ( `  roles/aiplatform.notebookExecutorUser  ` )  
    Follow [Grant a single role on a project](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#grant-single-role) to grant the Notebook Executor User role to your service account on the selected project.
  - [Storage Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/storage#storage.admin) ( `  roles/storage.admin  ` )  
    Follow [Add a principal to a bucket-level policy](/storage/docs/access-control/using-iam-permissions#bucket-add) to add your service account as a principal to the Cloud Storage bucket that you plan to use for storing output of notebooks executed in scheduled pipeline runs, and grant the Storage Admin role to this principal.

Additionally, you must grant the following roles to the default Dataform service agent:

  - [Service Account Token Creator](/iam/docs/service-account-permissions#token-creator-role) ( `  roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator  ` )  
    Follow [Grant token creation access to a service account](/dataform/docs/access-control#grant-token-creation-access) to add the default Dataform service agent as a principal to your service account, and grant the Service Account Token Creator role to this principal.
  - [Service Account User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountUser) ( `  roles/iam.serviceAccountUser  ` )  
    Follow [Grant or revoke multiple IAM roles using Google Cloud console](/iam/docs/manage-access-service-accounts#multiple-roles-console) to grant the Service Account User role to the default Dataform service agent on the custom service account.

To learn more about service accounts in Dataform, see [About service accounts in Dataform](/dataform/docs/access-control#about-service-accounts) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to manage pipelines, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles :

  - Delete pipelines: [Dataform Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.Admin) ( `  roles/dataform.Admin  ` ) on the pipeline
  - Create, edit, run, and delete pipeline schedules:
      - [Dataform Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.Admin) ( `  roles/dataform.Admin  ` ) on the pipeline
      - [Service Account User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountUser) ( `  roles/iam.serviceAccountUser  ` ) on the custom service account
  - View and run pipelines: [Dataform Viewer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.Viewer) ( `  roles/dataform.Viewer  ` ) on the project
  - View pipeline schedules: [Dataform Editor](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.Editor) ( `  roles/dataform.Editor  ` ) on the project

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

To enhance security for scheduling, see [Implement enhanced scheduling permissions](/dataform/docs/access-control#enhanced-scheduling-permissions) .

For more information about Dataform IAM, see [Control access with IAM](/dataform/docs/access-control) .

To use Colab notebook runtime templates when scheduling pipelines, you need the [Notebook Runtime User role](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/aiplatform#aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser) ( `  roles/aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser  ` ).

## Create a pipeline schedule

To create a pipeline schedule, follow these steps:

### **Explorer** pane

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Pipelines** , and then select a pipeline.

4.  Click **Schedule** .

5.  In the **Schedule pipeline** pane, in the **Schedule name** field, enter a name for the schedule.

6.  In the **Authentication** section, authorize the pipeline with your Google Account user credentials or a service account.
    
      - To use your Google Account user credentials ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ), select **Execute with my user credentials** .
      - To use a service account, select **Execute with selected service account** , and then select a service account.

7.  If your pipeline contains a notebook, in the **Notebook options** section, in the **Runtime template** field, select a Colab notebook runtime template or the default runtime specifications. For details on creating a Colab notebook runtime template, see [Create a runtime template](/colab/docs/create-runtime-template) .
    
    **Note:** A notebook runtime template must be in the same region as the pipeline.
    
    **Note:** If you don't have the [required role](#required_roles) for using Colab notebook runtime templates, you can still run and schedule pipelines with the default runtime specifications.

8.  If your pipeline contains a notebook, in the **Notebook options** section, in the **Cloud Storage bucket** field, click **Browse** and select or create a Cloud Storage bucket for storing the output of notebooks in your pipeline.
    
    Your selected service account must be granted the Storage Admin IAM role on the selected bucket. For more information, see [Enable pipeline scheduling](#enable-scheduling) .

9.  In the **Schedule frequency** section, do the following:
    
    1.  In the **Repeats** menu, select the frequency of scheduled pipeline runs.
    2.  In the **At time** field, enter the time for scheduled pipeline runs.
    3.  In the **Timezone** menu, select the timezone for the schedule.

10. Set the BigQuery query job priority with the **Execute as interactive job with high priority (default)** option. By default, BigQuery runs queries as [interactive query jobs](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#interactive-batch) , which are intended to start running as quickly as possible. Clearing this option runs the queries as [batch query jobs](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#interactive-batch) , which have lower priority.

11. Click **Create schedule** . If you selected **Execute with my user credentials** for your authentication method, you must [authorize your Google Account](#authorize-google-account) ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ).

When you create the schedule, the current version of the pipeline is automatically deployed. To update the schedule with a new version of the pipeline, [deploy the pipeline](#deploy) .

The latest deployed version of the pipeline runs at the selected time and frequency.

**Note:** If a scheduled pipeline run doesn't finish before the start of the next scheduled run, the next scheduled run is skipped and marked with an error.

### **Scheduling** page

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Scheduling** page.

2.  Click **Create** , and then select **Pipeline schedule** from the menu.

3.  In the **Schedule pipeline** pane, select a pipeline to schedule.

4.  In the **Schedule name** field, enter a name for the schedule.

5.  In the **Authentication** section, authorize the pipeline with your Google Account user credentials or a service account.
    
      - To use your Google Account user credentials ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ), select **Execute with my user credentials** .
      - To use a service account, select **Execute with selected service account** , and then select a service account.

6.  If your pipeline contains a notebook, in the **Notebook options** section, in the **Runtime template** field, select a Colab notebook runtime template or the default runtime specifications. For details on creating a Colab notebook runtime template, see [Create a runtime template](/colab/docs/create-runtime-template) .
    
    **Note:** A notebook runtime template must be in the same region as the pipeline.
    
    **Note:** If you don't have the [required role](#required_roles) for using Colab notebook runtime templates, you can still run and schedule pipelines with the default runtime specifications.

7.  If your pipeline contains a notebook, in the **Cloud Storage bucket** field, click **Browse** and select or create a Cloud Storage bucket for storing the output of notebooks in your pipeline.
    
    Your selected service account must be granted the Storage Admin IAM role on the selected bucket. For more information, see [Enable pipeline scheduling](#enable-scheduling) .

8.  In the **Schedule frequency** section, do the following:
    
    1.  In the **Repeats** menu, select the frequency of scheduled pipeline runs.
    2.  In the **At time** field, enter the time for scheduled pipeline runs.
    3.  In the **Timezone** menu, select the timezone for the schedule.

9.  Set the BigQuery query job priority with the **Execute as interactive job with high priority (default)** option. By default, BigQuery runs queries as [interactive query jobs](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#interactive-batch) , which are intended to start running as quickly as possible. Clearing this option runs the queries as [batch query jobs](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#interactive-batch) , which have lower priority.

10. Click **Create schedule** . If you selected **Execute with my user credentials** for your authentication method, you must [authorize your Google Account](#authorize-google-account) ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ).

**Note:** If a scheduled pipeline run doesn't finish before the start of the next scheduled run, the next scheduled run is skipped and marked with an error.

To authenticate the resource with your [Google Account](/iam/docs/principals-overview#google-account) user credentials, you must manually grant permission for BigQuery pipelines to get the access token for your Google Account and access the source data on your behalf. You can grant manual approval with the OAuth dialog interface.

You only need to give permission to BigQuery pipelines once.

To revoke the permission that you granted, follow these steps:

1.  Go to your [Google Account page](https://myaccount.google.com/) .
2.  Click **BigQuery Pipelines** .
3.  Click **Remove access** .

**Warning:** Revoking access permissions prevents any future pipeline runs that this Google Account owns across all regions.

Changing the pipeline schedule owner by updating credentials also requires manual approval if the new Google Account owner has never created a schedule before.

If your pipeline contains a notebook, you must also manually grant permission for Colab Enterprise to get the access token for your Google Account and access the source data on your behalf. You only need to give permission once. You can revoke this permission on the [Google Account page](https://myaccount.google.com/) .
