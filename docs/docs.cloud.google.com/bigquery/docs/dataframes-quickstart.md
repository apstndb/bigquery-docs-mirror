# Try BigQuery DataFrames

Use this quickstart to perform the following analysis and machine learning (ML) tasks by using the [BigQuery DataFrames API](https://dataframes.bigquery.dev/reference/index.html) in a [BigQuery notebook](/bigquery/docs/notebooks-introduction) :

  - Create a DataFrame over the `  bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins  ` public dataset.
  - Calculate the average body mass of a penguin.
  - Create a [linear regression model](https://dataframes.bigquery.dev/reference/api/bigframes.ml.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) .
  - Create a DataFrame over a subset of the penguin data to use as training data.
  - Clean up the training data.
  - Set the model parameters.
  - [Fit](https://dataframes.bigquery.dev/reference/api/bigframes.ml.linear_model.LinearRegression.fit.html) the model.
  - [Score](https://dataframes.bigquery.dev/reference/api/bigframes.ml.linear_model.LinearRegression.score.html) the model.

## Before you begin

1.  [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

2.  Verify that the BigQuery API is enabled.
    
    If you created a new project, the BigQuery API is automatically enabled.

### Required permissions

To create and run notebooks, you need the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles:

  - [BigQuery User ( `  roles/bigquery.user  ` )](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.user)
  - [Notebook Runtime User ( `  roles/aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser  ` )](/vertex-ai/docs/general/access-control#aiplatform.notebookRuntimeUser)
  - [Code Creator ( `  roles/dataform.codeCreator  ` )](/dataform/docs/access-control#dataform.codeCreator)

## Create a notebook

Follow the instructions in [Create a notebook from the BigQuery editor](/bigquery/docs/create-notebooks#create-notebook-console) to create a new notebook.

## Try BigQuery DataFrames

Try BigQuery DataFrames by following these steps:

1.  Create a new code cell in the notebook.

2.  Add the following code to the code cell:
    
    ``` text
    import bigframes.pandas as bpd
    
    # Set BigQuery DataFrames options
    # Note: The project option is not required in all environments.
    # On BigQuery Studio, the project ID is automatically detected.
    bpd.options.bigquery.project = your_gcp_project_id
    
    # Use "partial" ordering mode to generate more efficient queries, but the
    # order of the rows in DataFrames may not be deterministic if you have not
    # explictly sorted it. Some operations that depend on the order, such as
    # head() will not function until you explictly order the DataFrame. Set the
    # ordering mode to "strict" (default) for more pandas compatibility.
    bpd.options.bigquery.ordering_mode = "partial"
    
    # Create a DataFrame from a BigQuery table
    query_or_table = "bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins"
    df = bpd.read_gbq(query_or_table)
    
    # Efficiently preview the results using the .peek() method.
    df.peek()
    ```

3.  Modify the `  bpd.options.bigquery.project = your_gcp_project_id  ` line to specify your Google Cloud project ID. For example, `  bpd.options.bigquery.project = "myProjectID"  ` .

4.  Run the code cell.
    
    The code returns a `  DataFrame  ` object with data about penguins.

5.  Create a new code cell in the notebook and add the following code:
    
    ``` text
    # Use the DataFrame just as you would a pandas DataFrame, but calculations
    # happen in the BigQuery query engine instead of the local system.
    average_body_mass = df["body_mass_g"].mean()
    print(f"average_body_mass: {average_body_mass}")
    ```

6.  Run the code cell.
    
    The code calculates the average body mass of the penguins and prints it to the Google Cloud console.

7.  Create a new code cell in the notebook and add the following code:
    
    ``` text
    # Create the Linear Regression model
    from bigframes.ml.linear_model import LinearRegression
    
    # Filter down to the data we want to analyze
    adelie_data = df[df.species == "Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)"]
    
    # Drop the columns we don't care about
    adelie_data = adelie_data.drop(columns=["species"])
    
    # Drop rows with nulls to get our training data
    training_data = adelie_data.dropna()
    
    # Pick feature columns and label column
    X = training_data[
        [
            "island",
            "culmen_length_mm",
            "culmen_depth_mm",
            "flipper_length_mm",
            "sex",
        ]
    ]
    y = training_data[["body_mass_g"]]
    
    model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False)
    model.fit(X, y)
    model.score(X, y)
    ```

8.  Run the code cell.
    
    The code returns the model's evaluation metrics.

## Clean up

The easiest way to eliminate billing is to delete the project that you created for the tutorial.

To delete the project:

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `  appspot.com  ` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
