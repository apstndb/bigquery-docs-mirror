# VPC Service Controls for BigQuery

This page explains how to enhance security around BigQuery resources by creating perimeters with VPC Service Controls. These perimeters restrict access to and from BigQuery and are independent from Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls. They're useful in the following use cases:

  - Preventing data leakage by restricting access to resources, except those specifically allowed in the ingress and egress rules.
  - Securely loading data into BigQuery from third-party sources or Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Storage.
  - Controlling data export from BigQuery to Cloud Storage or other targets.

For more information, see the [overview of VPC Service Controls](/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview) .

## Before you begin

  - To get the permissions that you need to configure service perimeters, see [Access control with IAM](/vpc-service-controls/docs/access-control) for VPC Service Controls.
  - You must have an access policy for your organization. For more information, see [Create an access policy](/access-context-manager/docs/create-access-policy) .

## Create the VPC Service Controls perimeter

The following example shows how to create a VPC Service Controls perimeter that limits the range of external IP addresses that can access a BigQuery project.

1.  Create an *access level* that only allows access to a specified range of IP addresses—for example, those within a corporate network. To create it, use the [`  gcloud access-context-manager levels create  `](/sdk/gcloud/reference/access-context-manager/levels/create) command:
    
    ``` text
    echo """
    - ipSubnetworks:
      - 162.222.181.0/24
      - 2001:db8::/48
    """ > level.yaml
    
    gcloud access-context-manager levels create ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME \
        --title="TITLE" --basic-level-spec=level.yaml
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME  ` : the ID of the access level
      - `  TITLE  ` : the human-readable title for the service perimeter
    
    For more information about creating access levels, see the [example implementations](/access-context-manager/docs/create-basic-access-level#example_implementations) .

2.  Protect the BigQuery resource by creating or updating a perimeter. The following examples protect a project. For other use cases, such as protecting data transfer from a Cloud Storage bucket in another project, see the [use cases](#use-cases) .
    
    ### Create perimeter
    
    To create a new perimeter to protect the BigQuery project, use the [`  gcloud access-context-manager perimeters create  `](/sdk/gcloud/reference/access-context-manager/perimeters/create) command:
    
    ``` text
    echo """
    - ingressFrom:
        identityType: ANY_IDENTITY
        sources:
        - accessLevel: accessPolicies/POLICY_NAME/accessLevels/ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME
      ingressTo:
        operations:
        - methodSelectors:
          - method: '*'
          serviceName: bigquery.googleapis.com
        resources:
        - '*'
    
    """ > ingress.yaml
    
    gcloud access-context-manager perimeters create BIGQUERY_PERIMETER --title="TITLE" \
        --resources=BIGQUERY_PROJECT_NUMBER \
        --restricted-services=bigquery.googleapis.com \
        --ingress-policies=ingress.yaml
        --policy=POLICY_NAME
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  POLICY_NAME  ` : the ID of the access policy
      - `  ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME  ` : the ID of the access level
      - `  PERIMETER  ` : the ID of the perimeter
      - `  TITLE  ` : the short, human-readable title for the service perimeter
      - `  BIGQUERY_PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the ID of BigQuery project
      - `  POLICY_NAME  ` : the ID of the access policy
    
    ### Update perimeter
    
    To update an existing perimeter, use the [`  gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update  `](/sdk/gcloud/reference/access-context-manager/perimeters/update) command:
    
    ``` text
    gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update BIGQUERY_PERIMETER --set-ingress-policies=ingress.yaml
    ```
    
    Replace `  BIGQUERY_PERIMETER  ` with the ID of the perimeter protecting the BigQuery resource.

## Test the perimeter

Test your VPC Service Controls perimeter before enforcing it. For more information, see [Dry run mode for service perimeters](/vpc-service-controls/docs/dry-run-mode) and [Using dry-run mode to test ingress or egress policies](/vpc-service-controls/docs/ingress-egress-rules#using-dryrun-ingress-egress-rules) .

## Use cases

The following use case examples show how to protect data going in and out of BigQuery with VPC Service Controls.

### Query external table data from a Cloud Storage bucket in another project

The following examples show how to selectively allow communication between the BigQuery and Cloud Storage projects when they are separated by perimeters.

1.  Allow the BigQuery project to access the Cloud Storage project by updating the egress rules for the perimeter around the Cloud Storage project:
    
    ``` text
    echo """
    - egressFrom:
        identityType: ANY_IDENTITY
      egressTo:
        operations:
        - methodSelectors:
          - method: '*'
          serviceName: storage.googleapis.com
        resources:
        - projects/BIGQUERY_PROJECT_NUMBER
    """ > egress.yaml
    
    gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update CLOUD_STORAGE_PERIMETER --policy=POLICY_NAME --set-egress-policies=egress.yaml
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  BIGQUERY_PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the ID of BigQuery project
      - `  CLOUD_STORAGE_PERIMETER  ` : the ID of the perimeter protecting the Cloud Storage resources
      - `  POLICY_NAME  ` : the ID of the access policy

2.  Allow the Cloud Storage project to access the BigQuery project by updating the egress rules for the perimeter around the BigQuery project:
    
    ``` text
    echo """
    - egressFrom:
        identityType: ANY_IDENTITY
      egressTo:
        operations:
        - methodSelectors:
          - method: '*'
          serviceName: storage.googleapis.com
        resources:
        - projects/CLOUD_STORAGE_PROJECT_NUMBER
    """ > egress1.yaml
    
    gcloud access-context-manager perimeters update BIGQUERY_PERIMETER --policy=POLICY_NAME --set-egress-policies=egress1.yaml
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  CLOUD_STORAGE_PROJECT_NUMBER  ` : the ID of Cloud Storage project
      - `  PERIMETER  ` : the ID of the perimeter
      - `  POLICY_NAME  ` : the ID of the access policy

3.  Optional: if the perimeter protecting the BigQuery project includes `  storage.googleapis.com  ` as a restricted service, you must update the ingress rule:
    
    ``` text
    echo """
    - ingressFrom:
        identityType: ANY_IDENTITY
        sources:
        - accessLevel: accessPolicies/POLICY_NAME/accessLevels/ACCESS_LEVEL_NAME
      ingressTo:
        operations:
        - methodSelectors:
          - method: '*'
          serviceName: bigquery.googleapis.com
        - methodSelectors:
          - method: '*'
          serviceName: storage.googleapis.com
        resources:
        - '*'
    
    """ > ingress.yaml
    
    gcloud access-context-manager perimeters create BIGQUERY_PERIMETER --title="TITLE" \
        --resources=BIGQUERY_PROJECT_NUMBER \
        --restricted-services=bigquery.googleapis.com \
        --ingress-policies=ingress.yaml
        --policy=POLICY_NAME
    ```

### Import and export data from BigQuery Omni

As an extra layer of defense, you can use VPC Service Controls perimeters to restrict access between BigQuery Omni and an external cloud service. For more information and examples, see the [VPC Service Controls](/bigquery/docs/omni-azure-create-external-table#vpc-service) configuration for when you create an Azure Blob Storage BigLake table.
