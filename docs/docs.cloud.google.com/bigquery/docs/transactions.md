# Multi-statement transactions

BigQuery supports multi-statement transactions inside a single query, or across multiple queries when using sessions. A multi-statement transaction lets you perform mutating operations, such as inserting or deleting rows on one or more tables, and either commit or roll back the changes atomically.

Uses for multi-statement transactions include:

  - Performing DML mutations on multiple tables as a single transaction. The tables can span multiple datasets or projects.
  - Performing mutations on a single table in several stages, based on intermediate computations.

Transactions guarantee [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) properties and support snapshot isolation. During a transaction, all reads return a consistent snapshot of the tables referenced in the transaction. If a statement in a transaction modifies a table, the changes are visible to subsequent statements within the same transaction.

**Note:** Reads from external data sources are not guaranteed to be consistent within a transaction if the underlying data source changes during the transaction.

## Transaction scope

A transaction must be contained in a single SQL query, except when in [`  Session mode  `](/bigquery/docs/sessions-intro) . A query can contain multiple transactions, but they cannot be nested. You can run [multi-statement transactions](/bigquery/docs/sessions-write-queries#multi_transactions) over multiple queries in a session.

To start a transaction, use the [`  BEGIN TRANSACTION  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/procedural-language#begin_transaction) statement. The transaction ends when any of the following occur:

  - The query executes a [`  COMMIT TRANSACTION  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/procedural-language#commit_transaction) statement. This statement atomically commits all changes made inside the transaction.
  - The query executes a [`  ROLLBACK TRANSACTION  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/procedural-language#rollback_transaction) statement. This statement abandons all changes made inside the transaction.
  - The query ends before reaching either of these two statements. In that case, BigQuery automatically rolls back the transaction.

If an error occurs during a transaction and the query has an [exception handler](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/procedural-language#beginexceptionend) , then BigQuery transfers control to the exception handler. Inside the exception block, can choose whether to commit or roll back the transaction.

If an error occurs during a transaction and there is no exception handler, then the query fails and BigQuery automatically rolls back the transaction.

The following example shows an exception handler that rolls back a transaction:

``` text
BEGIN

  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO mydataset.NewArrivals
    VALUES ('top load washer', 100, 'warehouse #1');
  -- Trigger an error.
  SELECT 1/0;
  COMMIT TRANSACTION;

EXCEPTION WHEN ERROR THEN
  -- Roll back the transaction inside the exception handler.
  SELECT @@error.message;
  ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
END;
```

## Statements supported in transactions

The following statement types are supported in transactions:

  - Query statements: `  SELECT  `

  - DML statements: `  INSERT  ` , `  UPDATE  ` , `  DELETE  ` , `  MERGE  ` , and `  TRUNCATE TABLE  `

  - DDL statements on temporary entities:
    
      - `  CREATE TEMP TABLE  `
      - `  CREATE TEMP FUNCTION  `
      - `  DROP TABLE  ` on a temporary table
      - `  DROP FUNCTION  ` on a temporary function

DDL statements that create or drop permanent entities, such as datasets, tables, and functions, are not supported inside transactions.

### Date/time functions in transactions

Within a transaction, the following date/time functions have special behaviors:

  - The [`  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#current_timestamp) , [`  CURRENT_DATE  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/date_functions#current_date) , and [`  CURRENT_TIME  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/time_functions#current_time) functions return the timestamp when the transaction started.

  - You cannot use the [`  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#for_system_time_as_of) clause to read a table beyond the timestamp when the transaction started. Doing so returns an error.

## Example of a transaction

This example assumes there are two tables named `  Inventory  ` and `  NewArrivals  ` , created as follows:

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE mydataset.Inventory
(
 product string,
 quantity int64,
 supply_constrained bool
);

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE mydataset.NewArrivals
(
 product string,
 quantity int64,
 warehouse string
);

INSERT mydataset.Inventory (product, quantity)
VALUES('top load washer', 10),
     ('front load washer', 20),
     ('dryer', 30),
     ('refrigerator', 10),
     ('microwave', 20),
     ('dishwasher', 30);

INSERT mydataset.NewArrivals (product, quantity, warehouse)
VALUES('top load washer', 100, 'warehouse #1'),
     ('dryer', 200, 'warehouse #2'),
     ('oven', 300, 'warehouse #1');
```

The `  Inventory  ` table contains information about current inventory, and `  NewArrivals  ` contains information about newly arrived items.

The following transaction updates `  Inventory  ` with new arrivals and deletes the corresponding records from `  NewArrivals  ` . Assuming that all statements complete successfully, the changes in both tables are committed atomically as a single transaction.

``` text
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Create a temporary table that holds new arrivals from 'warehouse #1'.
CREATE TEMP TABLE tmp
  AS SELECT * FROM mydataset.NewArrivals WHERE warehouse = 'warehouse #1';

-- Delete the matching records from the NewArravals table.
DELETE mydataset.NewArrivals WHERE warehouse = 'warehouse #1';

-- Merge the records from the temporary table into the Inventory table.
MERGE mydataset.Inventory AS I
USING tmp AS T
ON I.product = T.product
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
 INSERT(product, quantity, supply_constrained)
 VALUES(product, quantity, false)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
 UPDATE SET quantity = I.quantity + T.quantity;

-- Drop the temporary table and commit the transaction.
DROP TABLE tmp;

COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

## Transaction concurrency

If a transaction mutates (update or deletes) rows in a table, then other transactions or DML statements that mutate rows in the same table cannot run concurrently. Conflicting transactions are cancelled. Conflicting DML statements that run outside of a transaction are queued to run later, subject to [queuing limits](/bigquery/docs/data-manipulation-language#update_delete_merge_dml_concurrency) .

Operations that read or append new rows can run concurrently with the transaction. For example, any of the following operations can be performed concurrently on a table while a transaction mutates data in the same table:

  - `  SELECT  ` statements
  - BigQuery Storage Read API read operations
  - Queries from BigQuery BI Engine
  - `  INSERT  ` statements
  - Load jobs that use `  WRITE_APPEND  ` disposition to append rows
  - Streaming writes

If a transaction only reads a table or appends new rows to it, any operation can be performed concurrently on that table.

## Viewing transaction information

BigQuery assigns a transaction ID to each multi-statement transaction. The transaction ID is attached to each query that executes inside the transaction. To view the transaction IDs for your jobs, query the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS*  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs) views for the `  transaction_id  ` column.

When a multi-statement transaction runs, BigQuery creates a child job for each statement in the transaction. For a given transaction, every child job that is associated with that transaction has the same `  transaction_id  ` value.

The following examples show how to find information about your transactions.

### Find all committed or rolled back transactions

The following query returns all transactions that were successfully committed.

``` text
SELECT transaction_id, parent_job_id, query
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE statement_type = "COMMIT_TRANSACTION" AND error_result IS NULL;
```

The following query returns all transactions that were successfully rolled back.

``` text
SELECT
  transaction_id, parent_job_id, query
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE statement_type = "ROLLBACK_TRANSACTION" AND error_result IS NULL;
```

### Find the start and end time of a transaction

The following query returns the starting and ending times for a specified transaction ID.

``` text
SELECT transaction_id, start_time, end_time, statement_type
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_USER
WHERE transaction_id = "TRANSACTION_ID"
AND statement_type IN
  ("BEGIN_TRANSACTION", "COMMIT_TRANSACTION", "ROLLBACK_TRANSACTION")
ORDER BY start_time;
```

### Find the transaction in which a job is running

The following query gets the transaction associated with a specified job ID. It returns `  NULL  ` if the job is not running within a multi-statement transaction.

``` text
SELECT transaction_id
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE job_id = 'JOB_ID';
```

### Find the current job running within a transaction

The following query returns information about the job that is currently running within a specified transaction, if any.

``` text
SELECT job_id, query, start_time, total_slot_ms
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE transaction_id = 'TRANSACTION_ID' AND state = RUNNING;
```

### Find the active transactions that affect a table

The following query returns the active transactions that affect a specified table. For each active transaction, if the transaction is running as part of multi-statement queries such as within a [stored procedure](/bigquery/docs/procedures) , then it also returns the parent job ID. If the transaction is running within a session, then it also returns the session info.

``` text
WITH running_transactions AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT transaction_id
  FROM
    `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
  EXCEPT DISTINCT
  SELECT transaction_id
  FROM
    `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
  WHERE
    statement_type = 'COMMIT_TRANSACTION'
    OR statement_type = 'ROLLBACK_TRANSACTION'
)
SELECT
  jobs.transaction_id, parent_job_id, session_info, query
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT AS jobs, running_transactions
WHERE
  destination_table = ("PROJECT_NAME", "DATASET_NAME", "TABLE_NAME")
  AND jobs.transaction_id = running_transactions.transaction_id;
```

### Find the active transactions running in a multi-statement transaction

The following query returns the active transactions for a particular job, specified by the ID of the job that is running the multi-statement transaction.

``` text
SELECT DISTINCT transaction_id
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE
  parent_job_id = "JOB_ID"
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT transaction_id
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE
  parent_job_id = "JOB_ID"
  AND (statement_type = 'COMMIT_TRANSACTION'
       OR statement_type = 'ROLLBACK_TRANSACTION');
```

## Limitations

  - Transactions cannot use DDL statements that affect permanent entities.

  - Within a transaction, [materialized views](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro) are interpreted as logical views. You can still query a materialized view inside a transaction, but it doesn't result in any performance improvement or cost reduction compared with the equivalent logical view.

  - A multi-statement transaction that fails triggers a rollback operation, undoing all pending changes and precluding retries.

  - A transaction can mutate data in at most 100 tables and can perform at most 100,000 partition modifications.

  - [BI Engine](/bigquery/docs/bi-engine-intro) does not accelerate queries inside a transaction.

  - Metadata for external data sources can't be refreshed within a transaction using [a system procedure](/bigquery/docs/reference/system-procedures#bqrefresh_external_metadata_cache) .
