# Oracle to BigQuery migration

This document provides high-level guidance on how to migrate from Oracle to BigQuery. It describes the fundamental architectural differences and suggesting ways of migration from data warehouses and data marts running on Oracle RDBMS (including Exadata) to BigQuery. This document provides details that can apply to Exadata, ExaCC, and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse also, as they use compatible Oracle software.

This document is for enterprise architects, DBAs, application developers, and IT security professionals who want to migrate from Oracle to BigQuery and solve technical challenges in the migration process.

You can also use [batch SQL translation](/bigquery/docs/batch-sql-translator) to migrate your SQL scripts in bulk, or [interactive SQL translation](/bigquery/docs/interactive-sql-translator) to translate ad hoc queries. Oracle SQL, PL/SQL, and Exadata are supported by both tools in [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .

## Pre-migration

To ensure a successful data warehouse migration, start planning your migration strategy early in your project timeline. For information about how to systematically plan your migration work, see [What and how to migrate: The migration framework](/bigquery/docs/migration/migration-overview#what_and_how_to_migrate_the_migration_framework) .

### BigQuery capacity planning

Under the hood, analytics throughput in BigQuery is measured in slots. A BigQuery slot is Google's proprietary unit of computational capacity required to execute SQL queries.

BigQuery continuously calculates how many slots are required by queries as they execute, but it allocates slots to queries based on a [fair scheduler](/bigquery/docs/slots#fair_scheduling_in_bigquery) .

You can choose between the following pricing models when capacity planning for BigQuery slots:

  - [On-demand pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#on_demand_pricing) : Under on-demand pricing, BigQuery charges for the number of bytes processed (data size), so you pay only for the queries that you run. For more information about how BigQuery determines data size, see [Data size calculation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#data) . Because slots determine the underlying computational capacity, you can pay for BigQuery usage depending on the number of slots you need (instead of bytes processed). By default, Google Cloud projects are limited to a maximum of 2,000 slots.

  - [Capacity-based pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#capacity_compute_analysis_pricing) : With capacity-based pricing, you purchase BigQuery slot [reservations](/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro) (a minimum of 100) instead of paying for the bytes processed by queries that you run. We recommend capacity-based pricing for enterprise data warehouse workloads, which commonly see many concurrent reporting and extract-load-transform (ELT) queries that have predictable consumption.

To help with slot estimation, we recommend setting up [BigQuery monitoring using Cloud Monitoring](/bigquery/docs/monitoring) and [analyzing your audit logs using BigQuery](/bigquery/audit-logs) . Many customers use [Looker Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/) (for example, see an [open source example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services/tree/master/examples/bigquery-audit-log) of a [Looker Studio dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/c/u/0/reporting/1kwNFt05J8_GCju5TBH1v4IlBmmAU74Nu/page/nSaN) ), [Looker](https://looker.com/) , or [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) as frontends to visualize BigQuery audit log data, specifically for slot usage across queries and projects. You can also leverage BigQuery system tables data for monitoring slot utilization across jobs and reservations. For an example, see an [open source example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-utils/tree/master/dashboards/system_tables) of a [Looker Studio dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/s/kGZzZJWkeyA) .

Regularly monitoring and analyzing your slot utilization helps you estimate how many total slots your organization needs as you grow on Google Cloud.

For example, suppose you initially reserve [4,000 BigQuery slots](/bigquery/docs/slots) to run 100 medium-complexity queries simultaneously. If you notice high wait times in the execution plans of your queries, and your dashboards show high slot utilization, this could indicate that you need additional BigQuery slots to help support your workloads. If you want to purchase slots yourself through yearly or three-year commitments, you can [get started with BigQuery reservations](/bigquery/docs/reservations-get-started) using the Google Cloud console or the bq command-line tool.

For any questions related to your current plan and the preceding options, contact your [sales representative](https://cloud.google.com/contact) .

### Security in Google Cloud

The following sections describe common Oracle security controls and how you can ensure that your data warehouse stays protected in a Google Cloud environment.

#### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Oracle provides [users, privileges, roles, and profiles](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/network.102/b14266/admusers.htm#DBSEG10000) to manage access to resources.

BigQuery uses [IAM](/iam) to manage access to resources and provides centralized [access management](/bigquery/docs/access-control) to resources and actions. The types of resources available in BigQuery include organizations, projects, datasets, tables, and views. In the IAM policy hierarchy, datasets are child resources of projects. A table inherits permissions from the dataset that contains it.

To grant access to a resource, assign one or more roles to a user, group, or service account. Organization and project roles affect the ability to run jobs or manage the project, whereas dataset roles affect the ability to access or modify the data inside a project.

IAM provides these types of roles:

  - [Predefined roles](/bigquery/docs/access-control) are meant to support common use cases and access control patterns. Predefined roles provide granular access for a specific service and are managed by Google Cloud.

  - [Basic roles](/bigquery/docs/access-control-basic-roles) include the Owner, Editor, and Viewer roles.
    
    **Caution:** BigQuery's dataset-level basic roles existed prior to the introduction of IAM. We recommend that you minimize the use of basic roles. In production environments, don't grant basic roles unless there is no alternative. Instead, use [predefined IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) roles.

  - [Custom roles](/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles) provide granular access according to a user-specified list of permissions.

When you assign both predefined and basic roles to a user, the permissions granted are a union of the permissions of each individual role.

#### Row-level security

[Oracle Label Security (OLS)](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/TDPSG/GUID-72D524FF-5A86-495A-9D12-14CB13819D42.htm#TDPSG94446) allows the restriction of data access on a row-by-row basis. A typical use case for row-level security is restricting a sales person's access to the accounts they manage. By implementing row-level security, you gain fine-grained access control.

To achieve row-level security in BigQuery, you can use [authorized views](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views) and [row-level access policies](/bigquery/docs/managing-row-level-security) . For more information about how to design and implement these policies, see [Introduction to BigQuery row-level security](/bigquery/docs/row-level-security-intro) .

#### Full-disk encryption

Oracle offers [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e40393/asotrans.htm#ASOAG600) and [network encryption](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/DBSEG/asoconfg.htm#DBSEG020) for data-at-rest and in-transit encryption. TDE requires the Advanced Security option, which is licensed separately.

BigQuery encrypts all data [at rest](/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption) and [in transit](/docs/security/encryption-in-transit) by default regardless of the source or any other condition, and this cannot be turned off. BigQuery also supports [customer-managed encryption keys](/bigquery/docs/customer-managed-encryption) (CMEK) for users who want to control and manage key encryption keys in [Cloud Key Management Service](/kms/docs) . For more information about encryption at Google Cloud, see [Default encryption at rest](/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption) and [Encryption in transit](/docs/security/encryption-in-transit) .

#### Data masking and redaction

Oracle uses [data masking](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e41481/tdm_data_masking.htm#RATUG04000) in Real Application Testing and [data redaction](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e40393/redaction.htm#ASOAG594) , which lets you mask (redact) data that is returned from queries issued by applications.

BigQuery supports [dynamic data masking](/bigquery/docs/column-data-masking-intro) at the column level. You can use data masking to selectively obscure column data for groups of users, while still allowing access to the column.

You can use the [Sensitive Data Protection](/sensitive-data-protection/docs) to identify and redact sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) on BigQuery.

### BigQuery and Oracle comparison

This section describes the key differences between BigQuery and Oracle. These highlights help you identify migration hurdles and plan for the changes required.

#### System architecture

One of the main differences between Oracle and BigQuery is that BigQuery is a serverless cloud EDW with separate storage and compute layers that can scale based on the needs of the query. Given the nature of the BigQuery serverless offering, you are not limited by hardware decisions; instead you can request more resources for your queries and users through reservations. BigQuery also does not require configuration of the underlying software and infrastructure such as operating system (OS), network systems, and storage systems including scaling and high-availability. BigQuery takes care of scalability, management, and administrative operations. The following diagram illustrates the BigQuery storage hierarchy.

Knowledge of the underlying storage and query processing architecture such as separation between storage (Colossus) and query execution (Dremel) and how Google Cloud allocates resources (Borg) can be good for understanding behavioral differences and optimizing query performance and cost effectiveness. For details, see the reference system architectures for [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/new-blog-series-bigquery-explained-overview) , [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/architecture-diagrams/18/technical-architecture/database-technical-architecture.html) , and [Exadata](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/exadata/exadata-x7-2-ds-3908482.pdf) .

#### Data and storage architecture

The data and storage structure is an important part of any data analytics system because it affects query performance, cost, scalability, and efficiency.

BigQuery [decouples data storage and compute](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/separation-of-storage-and-compute-in-bigquery) and stores data in Colossus, in which data is compressed and stored in a columnar format called [Capacitor](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/inside-capacitor-bigquerys-next-generation-columnar-storage-format) .

BigQuery operates directly on compressed data without decompressing by using Capacitor. BigQuery provides [datasets](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/datasets) as the highest-level abstraction to organize access to tables as shown in the preceding diagram. [Schemas](/bigquery/docs/schemas) and [labels](/bigquery/docs/adding-using-labels) can be used for further organization of tables. BigQuery offers [partitioning](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) to improve query performance and costs and to manage information lifecycle. Storage resources are allocated as you consume them and deallocated as you remove data or drop tables.

Oracle stores data in row format using [Oracle block format](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28318/logical.htm#CNCPT004) organized in segments. Schemas (owned by users) are used to organize tables and other database objects. As of Oracle 12c, [multitenant](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/multitenant/learn-more/multitenantwp18c-4396158.pdf) is used to create pluggable databases within one database instance for further isolation. [Partitioning](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/partitioning/partitioning-wp-12c-1896137.pdf) can be used to improve query performance and information lifecycle operations. Oracle offers several [storage options](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/CNCPT/physical.htm#CNCPT88986) for standalone and [Real Application Clusters (RAC)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/clustering/rac-twp-overview-5303704.pdf) databases such as ASM, an OS file system, and a cluster file system.

Exadata provides optimized storage infrastructure in storage cell servers and allows Oracle servers to access this data transparently by utilizing [ASM](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e18951/asmcon.htm#OSTMG036) . Exadata offers [Hybrid Columnar Compression (HCC)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/exadata/ehcc-twp-131254.pdf) options so that users can compress tables and partitions.

Oracle requires pre-provisioned storage capacity, careful sizing, and autoincrement configurations on segments, datafiles, and tablespaces.

#### Query execution and performance

BigQuery manages performance and scales on the query level to maximize performance for the cost. BigQuery uses many optimizations, for example:

  - [In-memory query execution](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/in-memory-query-execution-in-google-bigquery)
  - Multilevel tree architecture based on [Dremel](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/36632.pdf) execution engine
  - Automatic storage optimization within Capacitor
  - 1 petabit per second total bisection bandwidth with [Jupiter](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2015/06/A-Look-Inside-Googles-Data-Center-Networks.html)
  - [Autoscaling resource management](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/understanding-bigquerys-rapid-scaling-and-simple-pricing) to provide fast petabyte-scale queries

BigQuery gathers column statistics while loading the data and includes diagnostic [query plan](/bigquery/query-plan-explanation) [and timing](/bigquery/query-plan-explanation) information. Query resources are allocated according to query type and complexity. Each query uses some number of [slots](/bigquery/docs/slots) , which are units of computation that includes certain amount of CPU and RAM.

Oracle provides data [statistics](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14211/stats.htm#g49431) gathering jobs. The database [optimizer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/server.920/a96533/optimops.htm) uses statistics to provide optimal [execution plans](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/TGSQL/tgsql_genplan.htm#TGSQL271) . [Indexes](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e40540/indexiot.htm#CNCPT721) might be needed for fast row lookups and join operations. Oracle also provides an [in-memory column store](https://www.oracle.com/a/tech/docs/twp-oracle-database-in-memory-19c.pdf) for in-memory analytics. Exadata provides several performance improvements such as cell smart scan, storage indexes, flash cache, and InfiniBand connections between storage servers and database servers. [Real Application Clusters (RAC)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/options/clustering/rac-twp-overview-5303704.pdf) can be used for achieving server high availability and scaling database CPU-intensive applications using the same underlying storage.

Optimizing query performance with Oracle requires careful consideration of these options and database parameters. Oracle provides several tools such as Active Session History (ASH), Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM), Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) reports, SQL monitoring and Tuning Advisor, and Undo and Memory Tuning [Advisors](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADMQS/GUID-8DE70F1D-E161-45D2-BE01-E9972883BCEC.htm#ADMQS1031) for performance tuning.

#### Agile analytics

In BigQuery you can enable different projects, users, and groups to query datasets in different projects. Separation of query execution lets autonomous teams work within their projects without affecting other users and projects by separating slot quotas and querying billing from other projects and the projects that host the datasets.

#### High availability, backups, and disaster recovery

Oracle provides [Data Guard](https://www.oracle.com/database/data-guard/) as a disaster recovery and database replication solution. [Real Application Clusters (RAC)](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/rac.html) can be configured for server availability. [Recovery Manager (RMAN)](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/high-availability/rman.html) backups can be configured for database and archivelog backups and also used for restore and recovery operations. The [Flashback database](https://docs.oracle.com/html/E10643_07/rcmsynta023.htm) feature can be used for database flashbacks to rewind the database to a specific point in time. Undo tablespace holds table snapshots. It is possible to query old snapshots with the flashback query and " [as of](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e41502/adfns_flashback.htm#ADFNS01003) " query clauses depending on the DML/DDL operations done previously and the [undo retention](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28310/undo002.htm#ADMIN10180) settings. In Oracle, the whole integrity of the database should be managed within tablespaces that depend on the system metadata, undo, and corresponding tablespaces, because strong consistency is important for Oracle backup, and recovery procedures should include full primary data. You can schedule exports on the table schema level if point-in-time recovery is not needed in Oracle.

BigQuery is fully managed and different from traditional database systems in its complete backup functionality. You don't need to consider server, storage failures, system bugs, and physical data corruptions. BigQuery replicates data across different data centers depending on the [dataset location](/bigquery/docs/locations) to maximize reliability and availability. BigQuery multi-region functionality replicates data across different regions and protects against unavailability of a single zone within the region. BigQuery single-region functionality replicates data across different zones within the same region.

BigQuery lets you query historical snapshots of tables up to seven days and restore deleted tables within two days by using [time travel](/bigquery/docs/time-travel) . You can copy a deleted table (in order to restore it) by using the [snapshot syntax](/bigquery/docs/restore-deleted-tables) ( `  dataset.table@timestamp  ` ). You can [export](/bigquery/docs/exporting-data) data from BigQuery tables for additional backup needs such as to recover from accidental user operations. Proven backup strategy and schedules used for existing data warehouse (DWH) systems can be used for backups.

Batch operations and the snapshotting technique allow different backup strategies for BigQuery, so you don't need to export unchanged tables and partitions frequently. One export backup of the partition or table is enough after the load or ETL operation finishes. To reduce backup cost, you can store export files in Cloud Storage [Nearline Storage or Coldline Storage](/storage/docs/storage-classes) and define a [lifecycle policy](/storage/docs/lifecycle) to delete files after a certain amount of time, depending on the data retention requirements.

#### Caching

BigQuery offers per-user [cache](/bigquery/docs/cached-results) , and if data doesn't change, results of queries are cached for approximately 24 hours. If the results are retrieved from the cache, the query costs nothing.

Oracle offers several caches for data and query results such as [buffer cache](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/TGDBA/tune_buffer_cache.htm#TGDBA294) , [result cache](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/TGDBA/tune_result_cache.htm#TGDBA616) , [Exadata Flash Cache](http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/exadata-smart-flash-cache-366203.pdf) , and in-memory column store.

#### Connections

BigQuery handles connection management and does not require you to do any server-side configuration. BigQuery provides [JDBC and ODBC](/bigquery/partners/simba-drivers) drivers. You can use the [Google Cloud console](/bigquery/docs/bigquery-web-ui) or the `  bq command-line tool  ` for interactive querying. You can use [REST APIs](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2) and [client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) to programmatically interact with BigQuery You can [connect Google Sheets](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/connecting-bigquery-and-google-sheets-to-help-with-hefty-data-analysis) directly with BigQuery and use [ODBC and JDBC drivers](/bigquery/docs/reference/odbc-jdbc-drivers) to connect to Excel. If you are looking for a desktop client, there are free tools like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) .

Oracle provides [listeners](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETAG/listenercfg.htm#NETAG010) , [services](https://docs.oracle.com/html/E25494_01/create007.htm) , service handlers, several configuration and tuning [parameters](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/network.111/b28317/listener.htm#NETRF293) , and [shared and dedicated servers](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28310/manproc001.htm#ADMIN11166) to handle database [connections](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETAG/concepts.htm#NETAG002) . Oracle provides [JDBC](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e13995/oracle/jdbc/OracleDriver.html) , [JDBC Thin](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/java.111/b31224/jdbcthin.htm) , [ODBC](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADFNS/adfns_odbc.htm#ADFNS1112) drivers, [Oracle Client](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/install.112/e47959/install.htm#NTCLI1280) , and [TNS](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/network.111/b28317/tnsnames.htm#NETRF007) connections. Scan listeners, scan IP addresses, and scan-name are needed for [RAC configurations](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/RILIN/undrstnd.htm#RILIN006) .

#### Pricing and licensing

Oracle requires [license](https://www.oracle.com/assets/technology-price-list-070617.pdf) and support fees based on the core counts for Database editions and [Database options](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/dblic/Licensing-Information.html#GUID-B6113390-9586-46D7-9008-DCC9EDA45AB4) such as RAC, multitenant, Active Data Guard, partitioning, in-memory, Real Application Testing, GoldenGate, and Spatial and Graph.

BigQuery offers flexible [pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing) options based on storage, query, and streaming inserts usage. BigQuery offers [capacity-based pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#capacity_compute_analysis_pricing) for customers who need predictable cost and slot capacity in specific regions. Slots that are used for streaming inserts and loads are not counted on project slot capacity. To decide how many slots you want to purchase for your data warehouse, see [BigQuery capacity planning](#capacity_planning) .

BigQuery also automatically [cuts](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/google-bigquery-cuts-historical-data-storage-cost-in-half-and-accelerates-many-queries-by-10x) storage costs in half for unmodified data stored for more than 90 days.

#### Labeling

BigQuery datasets, tables, and views can be [labeled](/bigquery/docs/adding-using-labels) with key-value pairs. Labels can be used for differentiating storage costs and internal chargebacks.

#### Monitoring and audit logging

Oracle provides different levels and kinds of [database auditing](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e10575/tdpsg_auditing.htm#TDPSG50000) options and [audit vault](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/audit-vault-firewall.html) and [database firewall features](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/security/audit-vault-firewall.html) , which are licensed separately. Oracle provides [Enterprise Manager](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oem/enterprise-manager/overview/index.html) for database monitoring.

For BigQuery, [Cloud Audit Logs](/logging/docs/audit) is used for both data access logs and audit logs, which are enabled by default. The data access logs are available for 30 days, and the other system events and admin activity logs are available for 400 days. If you need longer retention, you can [export](/solutions/design-patterns-for-exporting-stackdriver-logging) logs to BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or Pub/Sub as described in [Security log analytics in Google Cloud](/solutions/design-patterns-for-exporting-stackdriver-logging) . If integration with an existing incident monitoring tool is needed, Pub/Sub can be used for exports, and custom development should be done on the existing tool to read logs from Pub/Sub.

Audit logs include all the API calls, query statements, and job statuses. You can use [Cloud Monitoring](/bigquery/docs/monitoring) to monitor slot allocation, bytes scanned in queries and stored, and other BigQuery [metrics](/bigquery/docs/monitoring#metrics) . BigQuery [query plan and timeline](/bigquery/query-plan-explanation) can be used to analyze query stages and performance.

You can use the [error messages table](/bigquery/troubleshooting-errors) for troubleshooting query job and API errors. To distinguish slot allocations per query or job, you can use this [utility](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/professional-services/tree/master/examples/bigquery-cross-project-slot-monitoring) , which is beneficial for customers that use capacity-based pricing and have many projects distributed across several teams.

#### Maintenance, upgrades, and versions

BigQuery is a fully managed service and does not require you to do any maintenance or upgrades. BigQuery does not offer different versions. Upgrades are continuous and don't require downtime or hinder system performance. For more information, see [Release notes](/bigquery/docs/release-notes) .

Oracle and Exadata require you to do database and underlying infrastructure-level patching, upgrades, and maintenance. There are many versions of Oracle and a new major version is planned to be released every year. Although new versions are backward-compatible, query performance, context, and features can change.

There can be applications that require specific versions such as 10g, [11g](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28279/chapter1.htm#NEWFTCH1) , or [12c](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NEWFT/chapter12102.htm#NEWFT003) . Careful planning and testing are needed for major database upgrades. Migration from different versions might include different technical conversion needs on query clauses and database objects.

#### Workloads

Oracle Exadata supports mixed workloads including OLTP workloads. BigQuery is designed for analytics and is not designed to handle OLTP workloads. OLTP workloads that use the same Oracle should be migrated into Cloud SQL, Spanner, or Firestore in Google Cloud. Oracle offers additional options such as Advanced Analytics and Spatial and Graph. These workloads might need to be rewritten for migration to BigQuery. For more information, see [Migrating Oracle options](#migrating-oracle-database-options) .

#### Parameters and settings

Oracle offers and requires many parameters to be configured and tuned on the [OS](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/cwlin/configuring-kernel-parameters-for-linux.html#GUID-6127884D-FB27-45FA-9498-B2540632CBD5) , [Database](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28320/dynviews_2085.htm#REFRN30176) , [RAC](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/RACAD/GUID-59DEC066-5743-4EDE-9A02-E8896005F658.htm#RACAD017) , [ASM](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/ostmg/init-params-asm-instance.html#GUID-E31FC459-3208-4390-9A27-2FB626520EC4) , and [Listener](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/network.102/b14213/listener.htm) levels for different workloads and applications. BigQuery is a fully managed service and does not require you to configure any initialization parameters.

#### Limits and quotas

Oracle has hard and soft limits based on infrastructure, hardware capacity, parameters, software versions, and licensing. BigQuery has [quotas and limits](/bigquery/quotas) on specific actions and objects.

#### BigQuery provisioning

BigQuery is a platform as a service (PaaS) and a Cloud massively parallel processing data warehouse. Its capacity scales up and down without any intervention from the user as Google manages the backend. As a result, unlike many RDBMS systems, BigQuery doesn't need you to provision resources before use. BigQuery allocates storage and query resources dynamically based on your usage patterns. Storage resources are allocated as you consume them and deallocated as you remove data or drop tables. Query resources are allocated according to query type and complexity. Each query uses slots. An eventual fairness scheduler is used, so there might be short periods where some queries get a higher share of slots, but the scheduler eventually corrects this.

In traditional VM terms, BigQuery gives you the equivalent of both:

  - Per-second billing
  - Per-second scaling

To accomplish this task, BigQuery does the following:

  - Keeps vast resources deployed to avoid having to rapidly scale.
  - Uses multitenant resources to instantly allocate large chunks for seconds at a time.
  - Efficiently allocates resources across users with economies of scale.
  - Charges you only for the jobs you run, rather than for deployed resources, so you pay for resources you use.

For more information about pricing, see [Understanding BigQuery rapid scaling and simple pricing](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/understanding-bigquerys-rapid-scaling-and-simple-pricing) .

## Schema migration

To migrate data from Oracle to BigQuery, you must know the Oracle data types and BigQuery mappings.

### Oracle data types and BigQuery mappings

Oracle data types differ from BigQuery data types. For more information about BigQuery data types, refer to the official [documentation](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types) .

For a detailed comparison between Oracle and BigQuery data types, see the [Oracle SQL translation guide](/bigquery/docs/migration/oracle-sql) .

### Indexes

In many analytical workloads, columnar tables are used instead of row stores. This greatly increases the column-based operations and eliminates the use of indexes for batch analytics. BigQuery also stores data in a columnar format, so indexes are not needed in BigQuery. If the analytics workload requires a single, small set of row-based access, [Bigtable](/bigtable/docs/overview#top_of_page) can be a better alternative. If a workload requires transaction processing with strong relational consistencies, [Spanner](/spanner/docs/overview) or [Cloud SQL](/sql/docs) can be better alternatives.

To summarize, no indexes are needed and offered in BigQuery for batch analytics. [Partitioning](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) or [clustering](/bigquery/docs/clustered-tables) can be used. For more information about how to tune and improve query performance in BigQuery, see [Introduction to optimizing query performance](/bigquery/docs/best-practices-performance-overview) .

### Views

Similar to Oracle, BigQuery allows creating custom views. However, [views in BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/views-intro) don't support DML statements.

### Materialized views

Materialized views are commonly used to improve report rendering time in write-once, read-many types of reports and workloads.

Materialized views are offered in Oracle to increase view performances by simply creating and maintaining a table to hold the query result dataset. There are two ways to refresh materialized views in Oracle: on-commit and on-demand.

[Materialized view functionality](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro) is also available in BigQuery. BigQuery leverages precomputed results from materialized views and whenever possible reads only delta changes from the base table to compute up-to-date results.

Caching functionalities in Looker Studio or other modern BI tools can also improve performance and eliminate the need to rerun the same query, saving costs.

### Table partitioning

Table partitioning is widely used in Oracle data warehouses. In contrast to Oracle, BigQuery does not support hierarchical partitioning.

BigQuery implements three types of [table partitioning](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) that allow queries to specify predicate filters based on the partitioning column to reduce the amount of data scanned.

  - [Tables partitioned by ingestion time](/bigquery/docs/creating-partitioned-tables) : Tables are partitioned based on the data's ingestion time.
  - [Tables partitioned by column](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables#date_timestamp_partitioned_tables) : Tables are partitioned based on a `  TIMESTAMP  ` or `  DATE  ` column.
  - [Tables partitioned by integer range](/bigquery/docs/creating-integer-range-partitions) : Tables are partitioned based on an integer column.

For more information about limits and quotas applied to partitioned tables in BigQuery, see [Introduction to partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) .

If the BigQuery restrictions affect the functionality of the migrated database, consider using [sharding](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables#dt_partition_shard) instead of partitioning.

Further, BigQuery does not support `  EXCHANGE PARTITION  ` , `  SPLIT PARTITION  ` , or converting a nonpartitioned table to a partitioned one.

### Clustering

Clustering helps efficiently organize and retrieve data stored in multiple columns that is often accessed together. However, Oracle and BigQuery have different circumstances in which clustering works best. In BigQuery, if a table is commonly filtered and aggregated with specific columns, use [clustering](/bigquery/docs/clustered-tables) . Clustering can be considered for migrating [list-partitioned](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/VLDBG/GUID-7221F7EC-4AFB-412F-8A4F-766CBE24CAE0.htm) or [index-organized](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28310/tables012.htm#ADMIN01506) tables from Oracle.

### Temporary tables

Temporary tables are often used in Oracle ETL pipelines. A temporary table holds data during a user session. This data is automatically deleted at the end of the session.

BigQuery uses temporary tables to cache query results that aren't written to a permanent table. After a query finishes, the temporary tables exist for up to 24 hours. The tables are created in a special dataset and named randomly. You can also create temporary tables for your own use. For more information, see [Temporary tables](/bigquery/docs/multi-statement-queries#temporary_tables) .

### External tables

Similar to Oracle, BigQuery lets you query [external data sources](/bigquery/external-data-sources) . BigQuery supports querying data directly from the external data sources including:

  - Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
  - Azure Blob Storage
  - Bigtable
  - Spanner
  - Cloud SQL
  - Cloud Storage
  - Google Drive

### Data modeling

Star or snowflake data models can be efficient for analytics storage and are commonly used for data warehouses on Oracle Exadata.

Denormalized tables eliminate expensive join operations and in most cases provide better performance for analytics in BigQuery. Star and snowflake data models are also supported by BigQuery. For more data warehouse design details on BigQuery, see [Designing schema](/solutions/bigquery-data-warehouse#designing_schema) .

#### Row format versus column format and server limits versus serverless

Oracle uses a row format in which the table row is stored in data blocks, so unneeded columns are fetched within the block for the analytic queries, based on filtering and aggregation of specific columns.

Oracle has a shared-everything architecture, with fixed hardware resource dependencies, such as memory and storage, assigned to the server. These are the two main forces underlying many data modeling techniques that evolved to improve efficiency of storage and performance of analytic queries. Star and snowflake schemas and data vault modeling are some of these.

BigQuery uses a columnar format to store data and does not have fixed storage and memory limits. This architecture lets you further denormalize and design schemas based on reads and business needs, reducing complexity and improving flexibility, scalability, and performance.

#### Denormalization

One of the main goals of relational database normalization is to reduce data redundancy. While this model is best suited for a relational database that uses a row format, data denormalization is preferable for columnar databases. For more information about advantages of denormalizing data and other query optimization strategies in BigQuery, see [Denormalization](/bigquery/docs/migration/schema-data-overview#denormalization) .

#### Techniques to flatten your existing schema

BigQuery technology leverages a combination of columnar data access and processing, in-memory storage, and distributed processing to provide quality query performance.

When designing a BigQuery DWH schema, creating a fact table in a flat table structure (consolidating all the dimension tables into a single record in the fact table) is better for storage utilization than using multiple DWH dimensions tables. On top of less storage utilization, having a flat table in BigQuery leads to less `  JOIN  ` usage. The following diagram illustrates an example of flattening your schema.

#### Example of flattening a star schema

Figure 1 shows a fictional sales management database that includes four tables:

  - Orders/sales table (fact table)
  - Employee table
  - Location table
  - Customer table

The primary key for the sales table is the `  OrderNum  ` , which also contains foreign keys to the other three tables.

#### Query to flatten the data using `     LEFT OUTER JOIN    `

``` text
#standardSQL
INSERT INTO flattened
SELECT
  orders.ordernum,
  orders.customerID,
  customer.fname,
  customer.lname,
  orders.salespersonID,
  employee.fname,
  employee.lname,
  employee.title,
  orders.amount,
  orders.location,
  location.city,
  location.state,
  location.zipcode
FROM orders
LEFT OUTER JOIN customer
  ON customer.customerID = orders.customerID
LEFT OUTER JOIN employee
  ON employee.salespersonID = orders.salespersonID
LEFT OUTER JOIN location
  ON location.locationID = orders.locationID
```

**Note:** BigQuery processes `  JOIN  ` s from left to right (top to bottom). Placing `  JOIN  ` s that reduce the number of records as early as possible in the chain increases query efficiency by reducing response time.

#### Nested and repeated fields

In order to design and create a DWH schema from a relational schema (for example, star and snowflake schemas holding dimension and fact tables), BigQuery presents the nested and repeated fields functionality. Therefore, relationships can be preserved in a similar way as a relational normalized (or partial normalized) DWH schema without affecting the performance. For more information, see [performance best practices](/bigquery/docs/best-practices-performance-input#denormalize_data_whenever_possible) .

To better understand the implementation of nested and repeated fields, look at a simple relational schema of a `  CUSTOMERS  ` table and `  ORDER  ` / `  SALES  ` table. They are two different tables, one for each entity, and the relationships are defined using a key such as a primary key and a foreign key as the link between the tables while querying using `  JOIN  ` s. BigQuery nested and repeated fields let you preserve the same relationship between the entities in one single table. This can be implemented by having all the customer data, while the orders data is nested for each of the customers. For more information, see [Specifying nested and repeated columns](/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated) .

To convert the flat structure into a nested or repeated schema, nest the fields as follows:

  - `  CustomerID  ` , `  FName  ` , `  LName  ` nested into a new field called `  Customer  ` .
  - `  SalesPersonID  ` , `  FName  ` , `  LName  ` nested into a new field called `  Salesperson  ` .
  - `  LocationID  ` , `  city  ` , `  state  ` , `  zip code  ` nested into a new field called `  Location  ` .

Fields `  OrderNum  ` and `  amount  ` are not nested, as they represent unique elements.

You want to make your schema flexible enough to allow for every order to have more than one customer: a primary and a secondary. The customer field is marked as repeated. The resulting schema is shown in Figure 2, which illustrates nested and repeated fields.

Figure 2: Logical representation of a nested structure

In some cases, denormalization using nested and repeated fields does not lead to performance improvements. For more information about limitations and restrictions, see [Specify nested and repeated columns in table schemas](/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated) .

#### Surrogate keys

It is common to identify rows with unique keys within the tables. Sequences are commonly used at Oracle to create these keys. In BigQuery you can create surrogate keys by using `  row_number  ` and `  partition by  ` functions. For more information, see [BigQuery and surrogate keys: a practical approach](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/bigquery-and-surrogate-keys-practical-approach) .

#### Keeping track of changes and history

When planning a BigQuery DWH migration, consider the concept of slowly changing dimensions (SCD). In general, the term SCD describes the process of making changes (DML operations) in the dimension tables.

For several reasons, traditional data warehouses use [different types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension) for handling data changes and keeping historical data in slowly changing dimensions. These type usages are needed by the hardware limitations and efficiency requirements discussed earlier. Because the storage is much cheaper than compute and infinitely scalable, data redundancy and duplication is encouraged if it results in faster queries in BigQuery. You can use [data snapshotting techniques](https://medium.com/%40maximebeauchemin/functional-data-engineering-a-modern-paradigm-for-batch-data-processing-2327ec32c42a) in which the whole data is loaded into new daily partitions.

#### Role-specific and user-specific views

Use role-specific and user-specific views when users belong to different teams and should see only records and results that they need.

BigQuery supports [column-](/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro) and [row-level security](/bigquery/docs/row-level-security-intro) . Column-level security provides fine-grained access to sensitive columns using policy tags, or type-based classification of data. Row-level security which lets you filter data and enables access to specific rows in a table based on qualifying user conditions.

## Data migration

This section provides information about data migration from Oracle to BigQuery, including initial load, change data capture (CDC), and ETL/ELT tools and approaches.

### Migration activities

It is recommended to perform migration in phases by identifying appropriate use cases for migration. There are multiple tools and services available to migrate data from Oracle to Google Cloud. While this list is not exhaustive, it does provide a sense of the size and scope of the migration effort.

  - **Exporting data out of Oracle:** For more information, see [Initial load](#initial_load) and [CDC and streaming ingestion from Oracle to BigQuery](#cdc-streaming-oracle-bigquery) . [ETL tools](#etl-elt-migration) can be used for the initial load.

  - **Data staging (in Cloud Storage):** Cloud Storage is the recommended landing place (staging area) for data exported from Oracle. Cloud Storage is designed for fast, flexible ingestion of structured or unstructured data.

  - **ETL process:** For more information, see [ETL/ELT migration](#etl-elt-migration) .

  - **Loading data directly into BigQuery:** You can load data into BigQuery directly from Cloud Storage, through Dataflow, or through real-time streaming. Use Dataflow when data transformation is required.

### Initial load

Migration of the initial data from the existing Oracle data warehouse to BigQuery might be different from the incremental ETL/ELT pipelines depending on the data size and the network bandwidth. The same ETL/ELT pipelines, can be used if the data size is a couple of terabytes.

If the data is up to a few terabytes, dumping the data and using `  gcloud storage  ` for the transfer can be much more efficient than using [JdbcIO](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/current/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/jdbc/JdbcIO.html) -like programmatic database extraction methodology, because programmatic approaches might need much more granular performance tuning. If the data size is more than a few terabytes and the data is stored in cloud or online storage (such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)), consider using [BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/dts-introduction) . For large-scale transfers (especially transfers with limited network bandwidth), [Transfer Appliance](/transfer-appliance) is a useful option.

#### Constraints for initial load

When planning for data migration, consider the following:

  - **Oracle DWH data size:** The source size of your schema carries a significant weight on the chosen data transfer method, especially when the data size is large (terabytes and above). When the data size is relatively small, the data transfer process can be completed in fewer steps. Dealing with large-scale data sizes makes the overall process more complex.

  - **Downtime:** Deciding whether downtime is an option for your migration to BigQuery is important. To reduce downtime, you can bulk load the steady historical data and have a CDC solution to catch up with changes that happen during the transfer process.

  - **Pricing:** In some scenarios, you might need third-party integration tools (for example, ETL or replication tools) that require additional licenses.

#### Initial data transfer (batch)

Data transfer using a batch method indicates that the data would be exported consistently in a single process (for example, exporting the Oracle DWH schema data into CSV, Avro, or Parquet files or importing to Cloud Storage to create datasets on BigQuery. All the ETL tools and concepts explained in [ETL/ELT migration](#etl-elt-migration) can be used for the initial load.

If you do not want to use an ETL/ELT tool for the initial load, you can write custom scripts to export data to files (CSV, Avro, or Parquet) and upload that data to Cloud Storage using `  gcloud storage  ` , BigQuery Data Transfer Service, or Transfer Appliance. For more information about performance tuning large data transfers and transfer options, see [Transferring your large data sets](/solutions/transferring-big-data-sets-to-gcp) . Then load data from Cloud Storage to [BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/introduction) .

Cloud Storage is ideal for handling the initial landing for data. Cloud Storage is a highly available and durable object storage service with no limitations on the number of files, and you pay only for the storage you use. The service is optimized to work with other Google Cloud services such as BigQuery and Dataflow.

### CDC and streaming ingestion from Oracle to BigQuery

There are several ways to capture the changed data from Oracle. Each option has trade-offs, mainly in the performance impact on the source system, development and configuration requirements, and pricing and licensing.

#### Log-based CDC

Oracle GoldenGate is Oracle's recommended tool for extracting redo logs, and you can use [GoldenGate for Big Data](https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/goldengate/big-data/12.3.2.1/gadbd/using-bigquery-handler.html#GUID-4568CD10-5495-4DB0-8E75-10F40451A8A7) for streaming logs into BigQuery. GoldenGate requires per-CPU licensing. For information about the price, see [Oracle Technology Global Price List](https://www.oracle.com/assets/technology-price-list-070617.pdf) . If Oracle GoldenGate for Big Data is available (in case licenses have already been acquired), using GoldenGate can be a good choice to create data pipelines to transfer data (initial load) and then sync all data modification.

#### Oracle XStream

Oracle stores every commit in redo log files, and these redo files can be used for CDC. [Oracle XStream Out](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/server.112/e16545/xstrm_intro.htm#XSTRM72650) is built on top of LogMiner and provided by third-party tools such as [Debezium](https://debezium.io/docs/connectors/oracle/) (as of version 0.8) or commercially using tools such as [Striim](https://www.striim.com/) . Using XStream APIs requires purchasing a license for Oracle GoldenGate even if GoldenGate is not installed and used. XStream enables you to propagate Streams messages between Oracle and other software efficiently.

#### Oracle LogMiner

No special license is required for [LogMiner](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/sutil/oracle-logminer-utility.html#GUID-3417B738-374C-4EE3-B15C-3A66E01AE2B5) . You can use the LogMiner option in the Debezium [community connector](https://github.com/erdemcer/kafka-connect-oracle) . It is also available commercially using tools such as Attunity, Striim, or [StreamSets](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/streamsets-legacy-dc) . LogMiner might have some performance impact on a very active source database and should be used carefully in cases when the volume of changes (the size of the redo) is more than 10 GB per hour depending on the server's CPU, memory, and I/O capacity and utilization.

#### SQL-based CDC

This is the incremental ETL approach in which SQL queries continuously poll the source tables for any changes depending on a monotonically increasing key and a timestamp column that holds the last modified or inserted date. If there is no monotonically increasing key, using the timestamp column (modified date) with a small precision (seconds) can cause duplicate records or missed data depending on the volume and comparison operator, such as `  >  ` or `  >=  ` .

To overcome such issues, you can use higher precision in timestamp columns such as six fractional digits (microseconds, which is the maximum supported precision in BigQuery, or you can add deduplication tasks in your ETL/ELT pipeline, depending on the business keys and data characteristics.

There should be an index on the key or timestamp column for better extract performance and less impact on the source database. Delete operations are a challenge for this methodology because they should be handled in the source application in a soft delete way, such as puttint a deleted flag and updating `  last_modified_date  ` . An alternative solution can be logging these operations in another table using a trigger.

#### Triggers

Database triggers can be created on source tables to log changes into shadow journal tables. Journal tables can hold entire rows to keep track of every column change, or they can only keep the primary key with the operation type (insert, update, or delete). Then changed data can be captured with an SQL-based approach described in [SQL-based CDC](#cdc-streaming-oracle-bigquery) . Using triggers can affect the transaction performance and double the single-row DML operation latency if a full row is stored. Storing only the primary key can reduce this overhead, but in that case, a `  JOIN  ` operation with the original table is required in the SQL-based extraction, which misses the intermediate change.

### ETL/ELT migration

There are many possibilities for handling ETL/ELT on Google Cloud. Technical guidance on specific ETL workload conversions is not in the scope of this document. You can consider a lift and shift approach or rearchitect your data integration platform depending on constraints such as cost and time. For more information about how to migrate your data pipelines to Google Cloud and many other migration concepts, see [Migrate data pipelines](/bigquery/docs/migration/pipelines) .

#### Lift and shift approach

If your existing platform supports BigQuery and you want to continue using your existing data integration tool:

  - You can keep the ETL/ELT platform as it is and change the necessary storage stages with BigQuery in your ETL/ELT jobs.
  - If you want to migrate the ETL/ELT platform to Google Cloud as well, you can ask your vendor whether their tool is licensed on Google Cloud, and if it is, you can install it on Compute Engine or check the Google Cloud Marketplace.

For information about the data integration solution providers, see [BigQuery partners](/bigquery#section-6) .

#### Rearchitecting ETL/ELT platform

If you want to rearchitect your data pipelines, we recommend that you strongly consider using Google Cloud services.

##### Cloud Data Fusion

[Cloud Data Fusion](/data-fusion) is a managed [CDAP](https://cdap.io/) on Google Cloud offering a visual interface with many plugins for tasks such as drag-and-drop and pipeline developments. Cloud Data Fusion can be used for capturing data from many different kinds of source systems and offers batch and streaming replication capabilities. Cloud Data Fusion or Oracle plugins can be used to capture data from an Oracle. A BigQuery plugin can be used to load the data to BigQuery and handle schema updates.

No output schema is defined both on source and sink plugins, and `  select * from  ` is used in the source plugin to replicate new columns as well.

You can use the Cloud Data Fusion Wrangle feature for data cleaning and preparing.

##### Dataflow

[Dataflow](/dataflow) is a serverless data processing platform that can autoscale as well as do batch and streaming data processing. Dataflow can be a good choice for Python and Java developers who want to code their data pipelines and use the same code for both streaming and batch workloads. Use the [JDBC to BigQuery template](/dataflow/docs/guides/templates/provided-batch#jdbctobigquery) to extract data from your Oracle or other relational databases and load it into BigQuery.

##### Cloud Composer

[Cloud Composer](/composer) is Google Cloud fully managed workflow orchestration service built on [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) . It lets you author, schedule, and monitor pipelines that span across cloud environments and on-premises data centers. Cloud Composer provides [operators](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/1.10.14/_api/index.html#operators) and [contributions](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/1.10.14/_api/airflow/contrib/operators/index.html) that can run multi-cloud technologies for use cases including extract and loads, transformations of ELT, and REST API calls.

Cloud Composer uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for scheduling and orchestrating workflows. To understand the general airflow concepts, see [Airflow Apache concepts](https://airflow.apache.org/concepts.html) . For more information about DAGs, see [Writing DAGs (workflows)](/composer/docs/how-to/using/writing-dags) . For sample ETL best practices with Apache Airflow, see [ETL best practices with Airflow documentation site¶](https://gtoonstra.github.io/etl-with-airflow/) . You can replace the Hive operator in that example with the [BigQuery operator](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-google/stable/operators/cloud/bigquery.html) , and the same concepts would be applicable.

The following sample code is a high-level part of a sample DAG for the preceding diagram:

##### Dataprep by Trifacta

[Dataprep](/bigquery/docs/data-prep-introduction) is a data service for visually exploring, cleaning, and preparing structured and unstructured data for analysis, reporting, and machine learning. You export the source data into JSON or CSV files, transform the data using Dataprep, and load the data using Dataflow. For an example, see [Oracle data (ETL) to BigQuery using Dataflow and Dataprep](https://medium.com/google-cloud/oracle-data-to-google-bigquery-using-google-cloud-dataflow-and-dataprep-20884571a9e5) .

##### Dataproc

[Dataproc](/dataproc) is a Google managed Hadoop service. You can use Sqoop to export data from Oracle and many relational databases into Cloud Storage as Avro files, and then you can load Avro files into BigQuery using the `  bq tool  ` . It is very common to install ETL tools like CDAP on Hadoop that use JDBC to extract data and Apache Spark or MapReduce for transformations of the data.

#### Partner tools for data migration

There are several vendors in the extraction, transformation, and load (ETL) space. ETL market leaders such as Informatica, Talend, Matillion, Infoworks, Stitch, Fivetran, and Striim have deeply integrated with both BigQuery and Oracle and can help extract, transform, load data, and manage processing workflows.

ETL tools have been around for many years. Some organizations might find it convenient to leverage an existing investment in trusted ETL scripts. Some of our key partner solutions are included on [BigQuery partner website](/bigquery#section-6) . Knowing when to choose partner tools over Google Cloud built-in utilities depends on your current infrastructure and your IT team's comfort with developing data pipelines in Java or Python code.

### Business intelligence (BI) tool migration

BigQuery supports a [flexible suite](/solutions/business-intelligence) of business intelligence (BI) solutions for Reporting and analysis that you can leverage. For more information about BI tool migration and BigQuery integration, see [Overview of BigQuery analytics](/bigquery/docs/query-overview) .

### Query (SQL) translation

BigQuery's [GoogleSQL](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql) supports compliance with the SQL 2011 standard and has extensions that support querying nested and repeated data. All ANSI-compliant SQL functions and operators can be used with minimal modifications. For a detailed comparison between Oracle and BigQuery SQL syntax and functions, see the [Oracle to BigQuery SQL translation reference](/bigquery/docs/migration/oracle-sql) .

Use [batch SQL translation](/bigquery/docs/batch-sql-translator) to migrate your SQL code in bulk, or [interactive SQL translation](/bigquery/docs/interactive-sql-translator) to translate ad hoc queries.

## Migrating Oracle options

This section presents architectural recommendations and references for converting applications that use Oracle Data Mining, R, and Spatial and Graph functionalities.

### Oracle Advanced Analytics option

Oracle offers advanced analytics options for data mining, fundamental machine learning (ML) algorithms, and R usage. The Advanced Analytics option requires licensing. You can choose from a comprehensive list of Google AI/ML products depending on your needs from development to production at scale.

#### Oracle R Enterprise

Oracle R Enterprise (ORE), a component of the Oracle Advanced Analytics option, makes the open source R statistical programming language integrate with Oracle Database. In standard ORE deployments, R is installed on an Oracle server.

For very large scales of data or approaches to warehousing, integrating R with BigQuery is an ideal choice. You can use the open source [bigrquery](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/google-cloud-platform-for-data-scientists-using-r-with-google-bigquery) R library to integrate R with BigQuery.

Google has partnered with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2018/large-scale-machine-learning-using-tensorflow-bigquery-and-cloudml-engine-within-rstudio/) to make the field's cutting-edge tools available to users. RStudio can be used to access terabytes of data in BigQuery fit models in TensorFlow, and run machine learning models at scale with AI Platform. In Google Cloud, [R can be installed on](/solutions/running-r-at-scale) [Compute Engine](/solutions/running-r-at-scale) at scale.

#### Oracle Data Mining

Oracle Data Mining (ODM), a component of the Oracle Advanced Analytics option, lets developers build machine learning models using Oracle PL/SQL Developer on Oracle.

BigQuery ML enables developers to run many different types of models, such as linear regression, binary logistic regression, multiclass logistic regression, k-means clustering, and TensorFlow model imports. For more information, see [Introduction to BigQuery ML](/bigquery/docs/bigqueryml-intro) .

Converting ODM jobs might require rewriting the code. You can choose from comprehensive [Google AI product offerings](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/) such as [BigQuery ML](/bigquery/docs/bqml-introduction) , AI APIs ( [Speech-to-Text](/speech-to-text) , [Text-to-Speech](/text-to-speech) , [Dialogflow](/dialogflow) , [Cloud Translation](/translate/docs) , [Cloud Natural Language API](/natural-language) , [Cloud Vision](/vision) , and more), or [Vertex AI](/vertex-ai) .

[Vertex AI Workbench](/vertex-ai/docs/workbench/introduction) can be used as a development environment for data scientists, and [Vertex AI Training](/vertex-ai/docs/training/overview) can be used to run training and scoring workloads at scale.

### Spatial and Graph option

Oracle offers the Spatial and Graph option for querying geometry and graphs and requires licensing for this option. You can use the geometry functions in BigQuery without additional costs or licenses and use other graph databases in Google Cloud.

#### Spatial

BigQuery offers [geospatial analytics](/bigquery/docs/gis) functions and data types. For more information, see [Working with](/bigquery/docs/gis-data) [geospatial analytics data](/bigquery/docs/gis-data) . Oracle Spatial data types and functions can be converted to [geography](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions) [functions in BigQuery standard SQL](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions) . Geography functions don't add cost on top of standard BigQuery pricing.

#### Graph

[JanusGraph](https://docs.janusgraph.org/) is an open source graph database solution that can use [Bigtable](/bigtable) as a storage backend. For more information, see [Running JanusGraph on GKE with Bigtable](/solutions/running-janusgraph-with-bigtable) .

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/neo4j-for-google-cloud/) is another graph database solution delivered as a Google Cloud service that runs on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).

### Oracle Application Express

Oracle Application Express (APEX) applications are unique to Oracle and need to be rewritten. Reporting and data visualization functionalities can be developed using [Looker Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/c/u/0/navigation/reporting) or BI engine, whereas application-level functionalities such as creating and editing rows can be developed without coding on [AppSheet](https://www.appsheet.com/) using [Cloud SQL](/sql/docs) .
