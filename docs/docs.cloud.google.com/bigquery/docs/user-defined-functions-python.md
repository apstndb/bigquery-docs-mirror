# Work with user-defined functions in Python

A Python user-defined function (UDF) lets you implement a scalar function in Python and use it in a SQL query. Python UDFs are similar to [SQL and Javascript UDFs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions) , but with additional capabilities. Python UDFs let you install third-party libraries from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) and let you access external services using a [Cloud resource connection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection) .

Python UDFs are built and run on BigQuery managed resources.

## Limitations

  - `python-3.11` is the only supported runtime.
  - You can't create a temporary Python UDF.
  - You can't use a Python UDF with a materialized view.
  - The results of a query that calls a Python UDF aren't cached because the return value of a Python UDF is always assumed to be non-deterministic.
  - [Assured workloads](https://docs.cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/overview) aren't supported.
  - These data types are not supported: `JSON` , `RANGE` , `INTERVAL` , and `GEOGRAPHY` .
  - Containers that run Python UDFs can only be configured up to [4 vCpu and 16 GiB](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/user-defined-functions-python#configure-container-limits) .
  - Encrypting Python UDF code with [Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)](https://docs.cloud.google.com/kms/docs/cmek) isn't supported.
  - Python UDFs support VPC Service Controls, but [VPC networks](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc) aren't supported.

## Required roles

The required IAM roles are based on whether you are a Python UDF owner or a Python UDF user.

### UDF owners

A Python UDF owner typically creates or updates a UDF. Additional roles are also required if you create a Python UDF that references a Cloud resource connection. This connection is required only if your UDF uses the [`WITH CONNECTION`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/user-defined-functions-python#use-online-service) clause to access an external service.

To get the permissions that you need to create or update a Python UDF, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles:

  - [BigQuery Data Editor](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataEditor) ( `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` ) on the dataset
  - [BigQuery Job User](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.jobUser) ( `roles/bigquery.jobUser` ) on the project
  - [BigQuery Connection Admin](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.connectionAdmin) ( `roles/bigquery.connectionAdmin` ) on the project

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to create or update a Python UDF. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create or update a Python UDF:

  - Create a Python UDF using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement: `bigquery.routines.create` on the dataset
  - Update a Python UDF using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement: `bigquery.routines.update` on the dataset
  - Run a `CREATE FUNCTION` statement query job: `bigquery.jobs.create` on the project
  - [Create a new Cloud resource connection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection#create-cloud-resource-connection) : `bigquery.connections.create` on the project
  - Use a connection in the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement: `bigquery.connections.delegate` on the connection

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information about roles in BigQuery, see [Predefined IAM roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery) .

### UDF users

A Python UDF user invokes a UDF created by someone else. Additional roles are also required if you invoke a Python UDF that references a Cloud resource connection.

To get the permissions that you need to invoke a Python UDF created by someone else, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles:

  - [BigQuery User](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.user) ( `roles/bigquery.user` ) on the project
  - [BigQuery Data Viewer](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataViewer) ( `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` ) on the dataset
  - [BigQuery Connection User](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.connectionUser) ( `roles/bigquery.connectionUser` ) on the connection

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to invoke a Python UDF created by someone else. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to invoke a Python UDF created by someone else:

  - To run a query job that references a Python UDF: `bigquery.jobs.create` on the project
  - To invoke a Python UDF created by someone else: `bigquery.routines.get` on the dataset
  - To run a Python UDF that references a Cloud resource connection: `bigquery.connections.use` on the connection

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information about roles in BigQuery, see [Predefined IAM roles](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery) .

## Create a persistent Python UDF

Follow these rules when you create a Python UDF:

  - The body of the Python UDF must be a quoted string literal that represents the Python code. To learn more about quoted string literals, see [Formats for quoted literals](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical#quoted_literals) .

  - The body of the Python UDF must include a Python function that is used in the `entry_point` argument in the Python UDF options list.

  - A Python runtime version needs to be specified in the `runtime_version` option. The only supported Python runtime version is `python-3.11` . For a full list of available options, see the [Function option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#function_option_list) for the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement.

To create a persistent Python UDF, use the [`CREATE FUNCTION` statement](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_function_statement) without the `TEMP` or `TEMPORARY` keyword. To delete a persistent Python UDF, use the [`DROP FUNCTION`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#drop_function_statement) statement.

### Example

To see an example of creating a persistent Python UDF, choose on of the following options:

### Console

The following example creates a persistent Python UDF named `multiplyInputs` and calls the UDF from within a `SELECT` statement:

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following `CREATE FUNCTION` statement:
    
        CREATE FUNCTION `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.multiplyInputs(x FLOAT64, y FLOAT64)
        RETURNS FLOAT64
        LANGUAGE python
        OPTIONS(runtime_version="python-3.11", entry_point="multiply")
        AS r'''
        
        def multiply(x, y):
            return x * y
        
        ''';
        
        -- Call the Python UDF.
        WITH numbers AS
            (SELECT 1 AS x, 5 as y
            UNION ALL
            SELECT 2 AS x, 10 as y
            UNION ALL
            SELECT 3 as x, 15 as y)
        SELECT x, y,
        `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.multiplyInputs(x, y) AS product
        FROM numbers;
    
    Replace PROJECT\_ID . DATASET\_ID with your project ID and dataset ID.

3.  Click play\_circle\_filled **Run** .
    
    This example produces the following output:
    
        +-----+-----+--------------+
        | x   | y   | product      |
        +-----+-----+--------------+
        | 1   | 5   |  5.0         |
        | 2   | 10  | 20.0         |
        | 3   | 15  | 45.0         |
        +-----+-----+--------------+

### BigQuery DataFrames

The following example uses BigQuery DataFrames to turn a custom function into a Python UDF:

    import bigframes.pandas as bpd
    
    # Set BigQuery DataFrames options
    bpd.options.bigquery.project = your_gcp_project_id
    bpd.options.bigquery.location = "US"
    
    # BigQuery DataFrames gives you the ability to turn your custom functions
    # into a BigQuery Python UDF. One can find more details about the usage and
    # the requirements via `help` command.
    help(bpd.udf)
    
    # Read a table and inspect the column of interest.
    df = bpd.read_gbq("bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins")
    df["body_mass_g"].peek(10)
    
    # Define a custom function, and specify the intent to turn it into a
    # BigQuery Python UDF. Let's try a `pandas`-like use case in which we want
    # to apply a user defined function to every value in a `Series`, more
    # specifically bucketize the `body_mass_g` value of the penguins, which is a
    # real number, into a category, which is a string.
    @bpd.udf(
        dataset=your_bq_dataset_id,
        name=your_bq_routine_id,
    )
    def get_bucket(num: float) -> str:
        if not num:
            return "NA"
        boundary = 4000
        return "at_or_above_4000" if num >= boundary else "below_4000"
    
    # Then we can apply the udf on the `Series` of interest via
    # `apply` API and store the result in a new column in the DataFrame.
    df = df.assign(body_mass_bucket=df["body_mass_g"].apply(get_bucket))
    
    # This will add a new column `body_mass_bucket` in the DataFrame. You can
    # preview the original value and the bucketized value side by side.
    df[["body_mass_g", "body_mass_bucket"]].peek(10)
    
    # The above operation was possible by doing all the computation on the
    # cloud through an underlying BigQuery Python UDF that was created to
    # support the user's operations in the Python code.
    
    # The BigQuery Python UDF created to support the BigQuery DataFrames
    # udf can be located via a property `bigframes_bigquery_function`
    # set in the udf object.
    print(f"Created BQ Python UDF: {get_bucket.bigframes_bigquery_function}")
    
    # If you have already defined a custom function in BigQuery, either via the
    # BigQuery Google Cloud Console or with the `udf` decorator,
    # or otherwise, you may use it with BigQuery DataFrames with the
    # `read_gbq_function` method. More details are available via the `help`
    # command.
    help(bpd.read_gbq_function)
    
    existing_get_bucket_bq_udf = get_bucket.bigframes_bigquery_function
    
    # Here is an example of using `read_gbq_function` to load an existing
    # BigQuery Python UDF.
    df = bpd.read_gbq("bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins")
    get_bucket_function = bpd.read_gbq_function(existing_get_bucket_bq_udf)
    
    df = df.assign(body_mass_bucket=df["body_mass_g"].apply(get_bucket_function))
    df.peek(10)
    
    # Let's continue trying other potential use cases of udf. Let's say we
    # consider the `species`, `island` and `sex` of the penguins sensitive
    # information and want to redact that by replacing with their hash code
    # instead. Let's define another scalar custom function and decorate it
    # as a udf. The custom function in this example has external package
    # dependency, which can be specified via `packages` parameter.
    @bpd.udf(
        dataset=your_bq_dataset_id,
        name=your_bq_routine_id,
        packages=["cryptography"],
    )
    def get_hash(input: str) -> str:
        from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
    
        # handle missing value
        if input is None:
            input = ""
    
        key = Fernet.generate_key()
        f = Fernet(key)
        return f.encrypt(input.encode()).decode()
    
    # We can use this udf in another `pandas`-like API `map` that
    # can be applied on a DataFrame
    df_redacted = df[["species", "island", "sex"]].map(get_hash)
    df_redacted.peek(10)
    
    # If the BigQuery routine is no longer needed, we can clean it up
    # to free up any cloud quota
    session = bpd.get_global_session()
    session.bqclient.delete_routine(f"{your_bq_dataset_id}.{your_bq_routine_id}")

## Container build status

When you create a Python UDF using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement, BigQuery creates or updates a container image that is based on a base image. The container is built on the base image using your code and any specified package dependencies.

Creating the container is a long-running process. The first query after you run the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement waits for the image build to complete. If there are no external dependencies, the container image is typically created in less than a minute.

The size of all Python UDF containers per project and per region is restricted to a sum total of 10GiB. For more information, see [User-defined function limits for persistent UDFs](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#udf_limits) . Your container build fails if your project has reached the quota.

To see the status of your container build, choose one of the following:

### Console

1.  Go to the BigQuery **Studio** page.

2.  In the left pane, expand your project and then click **Datasets** .

3.  Click the link to open the dataset that contains your Python UDF.

4.  On the dataset page, click the **Routines** tab.

5.  In the **Routine ID** column, click your Python UDF.

6.  On the **Persistent function info** page, you can view the build status, build duration, and image size. The build status is one of the following:
    
      - In progress
      - Succeeded
      - Failed
    
    If a build fails, the function information page provides detailed error messages so you can troubleshoot issues such as syntax errors or problems installing external packages.
    
    ![The Persistent function info page in the console.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/images/function-details.png)

### SQL

To query the build status fields in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES` view, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the BigQuery **Studio** page.

2.  Switch to the query editor or click add\_box **SQL query** .

3.  Enter the following query to retrieve the `BUILD_STATUS` fields from the [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES` view](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-routines) . The `BUILD_STATUS` column is a [`STRUCT`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#struct_type) type in GoogleSQL:
    
        SELECT
          build_status.*
        FROM
          `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES;
    
    Replace PROJECT\_ID . DATASET\_ID with your project ID and dataset ID.
    
    The output should look like the following. Error fields are omitted:
    
        +---------------+--------------------------------+------------------------+------------------+
        | build_state   | build_state_update_time        | build_duration_seconds | image_size_bytes |
        +---------------+--------------------------------+------------------------+------------------+
        | SUCCEEDED     | 2026-05-14 17:21:49.736000 UTC |                     11 |             3167 |
        +---------------+--------------------------------+------------------------+------------------+

### API

View the container build status by using [`RoutineBuildStatus`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/routines#routinebuildstatus) in the API.

## Create a vectorized Python UDF

You can implement your Python UDF to process a batch of rows instead of a single row by using vectorization. Vectorization can improve query performance. You can create a vectorized UDF using either Pandas or Apache Arrow.

To control batching behavior, specify the maximum number of rows in each batch by using the `max_batching_rows` option in the [`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#function_option_list) . If you specify `max_batching_rows` , BigQuery determines the number of rows in a batch, up to the `max_batching_rows` limit. If `max_batching_rows` is not specified, the number of rows to batch is determined automatically.

### Use Pandas

A vectorized Python UDF has a single [`pandas.DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) argument that must be annotated. The `pandas.DataFrame` argument has the same number of columns as the Python UDF parameters defined in the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement. The column names in the `pandas.DataFrame` argument have the same names as the UDF's parameters.

Your function needs to return either a [`pandas.Series`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.html#pandas.Series) or a single-column `pandas.DataFrame` with the same number of rows as the input.

The following example creates a vectorized Python UDF named `multiplyInputs` with two parameters— `x` and `y` :

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following `CREATE FUNCTION` statement:
    
        CREATE FUNCTION `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.multiplyVectorized(x FLOAT64, y FLOAT64)
        RETURNS FLOAT64
        LANGUAGE python
        OPTIONS(runtime_version="python-3.11", entry_point="vectorized_multiply")
        AS r'''
        import pandas as pd
        
        def vectorized_multiply(df: pd.DataFrame):
          return df['x'] * df['y']
        
        ''';
    
    Replace PROJECT\_ID . DATASET\_ID with your project ID and dataset ID.
    
    Calling the UDF is the same as in the previous example.

3.  Click play\_circle\_filled **Run** .

### Use Apache Arrow

The following example uses the Apache Arrow [`RecordBatch` interface](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.RecordBatch.html#pyarrow.RecordBatch) . When you use the `RecordBatch` interface, the function passes a batch of rows of columns of equal length to the entrypoint. The following example uses Apache Arrow to create a vectorized Python UDF named `multiplyVectorizedArrow` .

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following `CREATE FUNCTION` statement:
    
        CREATE FUNCTION `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.multiplyVectorizedArrow(x FLOAT64, y FLOAT64)
        RETURNS FLOAT64
        LANGUAGE python
        OPTIONS(
          runtime_version="python-3.11",
          entry_point="vectorized_multiply_arrow"
        )
        AS r'''
        import pyarrow as pa
        import pyarrow.compute as pc
        
        def vectorized_multiply_arrow(batch: pa.RecordBatch):
            # Access columns directly from the Arrow RecordBatch
            x = batch.column('x')
            y = batch.column('y')
        
            # Use pyarrow.compute for vectorized operations
            return pc.multiply(x, y)
        ''';
    
    Replace PROJECT\_ID . DATASET\_ID with your project ID and dataset ID.
    
    Calling the UDF is the same as in the previous examples.

3.  Click play\_circle\_filled **Run** .

## Call a Python UDF

If you have permission to invoke a Python UDF, then you can call it like any other function. To use a function defined in a different project, use the fully qualified name for the function. For example, to call an XML extraction function named [`cw_xml_extract`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/\(https:/github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-utils/blob/master/udfs/community/cw_xml_extract.sqlx\)) in another project, complete the following steps.

> **Note:** This example is based on a sample from [bigquery-utils](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-utils) .

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following example:
    
        SELECT
          `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.`cw_xml_extract`(xml, '//title/text()') AS `title`
        FROM UNNEST([
          STRUCT('''<book id="1">
            <title>The Great Gatsby</title>
            <author>F. Scott Fitzgerald</author>
          </book>''' AS xml),
          STRUCT('''<book id="2">
            <title>1984</title>
            <author>George Orwell</author>
          </book>''' AS xml),
          STRUCT('''<book id="3">
            <title>Brave New World</title>
            <author>Aldous Huxley</author>
          </book>''' AS xml)
        ])

3.  Click play\_circle\_filled **Run** .
    
    This example produces the following output:
    
        +--------------------------+
        | title                    |
        +--------------------------+
        | The Great Gatsby         |
        | 1984                     |
        | Brave New World          |
        +--------------------------+

### BigQuery DataFrames

The following example uses the [BigQuery DataFrames](https://dataframes.bigquery.dev/index.html) [`sql_scalar`](https://dataframes.bigquery.dev/reference/api/bigframes.bigquery.sql_scalar.html) , [`read_gbq_function`](https://dataframes.bigquery.dev/reference/api/bigframes.pandas.read_gbq_function.html) , and [`apply`](https://dataframes.bigquery.dev/reference/api/bigframes.pandas.Series.apply.html) methods to call a Python UDF:

    import textwrap
    from typing import Tuple
    
    import bigframes.pandas as bpd
    import pandas as pd
    import pyarrow as pa

    ) -> Tuple[pd.Series, bpd.Series]:
        # Set the billing project to use for queries. This step is optional, as the
        # project can be inferred from your environment in many cases.
        bpd.options.bigquery.project = project_id  # "your-project-id"
    
        # Since this example works with local data, set a processing location.
        bpd.options.bigquery.location = location  # "US"

## Use third-party packages

You can use the [`CREATE FUNCTION` option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#function_option_list) to use modules other than those provided by the [Python standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) and pre-installed packages. You can install packages from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/) , or you can import Python files from Cloud Storage.

### Install a package from the Python package index

When you install a package, you must provide the package name, and you can optionally provide the package version using [Python package version specifiers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers) .

If the package is in the runtime, that package is used unless a particular version is specified in the `CREATE FUNCTION` option list. If a package version is not specified, and the package isn't in the runtime, the latest available version is used. Only packages with [the wheels binary format](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427) are supported.

The following example shows you how to create a Python UDF that installs the `scipy` package using the `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` option list:

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following `CREATE FUNCTION` statement:
    
        CREATE FUNCTION `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.area(radius FLOAT64)
        RETURNS FLOAT64 LANGUAGE python
        OPTIONS (entry_point='area_handler', runtime_version='python-3.11', packages=['scipy==1.15.3'])
        AS r"""
        import scipy
        
        def area_handler(radius):
          return scipy.constants.pi*radius*radius
        """;
        
        SELECT `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.area(4.5);
    
    Replace PROJECT\_ID . DATASET\_ID with your project ID and dataset ID.

3.  Click play\_circle\_filled **Run** .

### Import additional Python files as libraries

You can extend your Python UDFs using the [Function option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#function_option_list) by importing Python files from Cloud Storage.

> **Note:** The user that creates the UDF needs the [`storage.objects.get`](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-permissions#objects) permission on the Cloud Storage bucket.

In your UDF's Python code, you can import the Python files from Cloud Storage as modules by using the import statement followed by the path to the Cloud Storage object. For example, if you are importing `gs://BUCKET_NAME/path/to/lib1.py` , then your import statement would be `import path.to.lib1` .

The Python filename needs to be a Python identifier. Each `folder` name in the object name (after the `/` ) should be a valid Python identifier. Within the ASCII range (U+0001..U+007F), the following characters can be used in identifiers:

  - Uppercase and lowercase letters A through Z.
  - Underscores.
  - The digits zero through nine, but a number cannot appear as the first character in the identifier.

The following example shows you how to create a Python UDF that imports the `lib1.py` client library package from a Cloud Storage bucket named `my_bucket` :

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following `CREATE FUNCTION` statement:
    
        CREATE FUNCTION `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.myFunc(a FLOAT64, b STRING)
        RETURNS STRING LANGUAGE python
        OPTIONS (
        entry_point='compute', runtime_version='python-3.11',
        library=['gs://BUCKET_NAME/PATH/lib1.py'])
        AS r"""
        import path.to.lib1 as lib1
        
        def compute(a, b):
          # doInterestingStuff is a function defined in
          # gs://BUCKET_NAME/PATH/lib1.py
          return lib1.doInterestingStuff(a, b);
        
        """;
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - PROJECT\_ID : your project ID.
      - DATASET\_ID : your dataset ID.
      - BUCKET\_NAME : the name of the Cloud Storage bucket that contains `lib1.py` .
      - PATH : the path to the Cloud Storage bucket.

3.  Click play\_circle\_filled **Run** .

## Configure container limits for Python UDFs

You can use the [`CREATE FUNCTION` option list](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#function_option_list) to specify CPU, memory, and container request concurrency limits for containers that run Python UDFs.

By default, containers are allocated the following resources:

  - The memory allocated is `512Mi` .
  - The CPU allocated is `1.0` vCPU.
  - The container request concurrency limit is `80` .

> **Note:** If you set CPU allocation to less than `1.0` vCPU, and you don't set the container request concurrency limit, the container request concurrency is set to `1` at run time.

The following example creates a Python UDF using the `CREATE FUNCTION` option list to specify container limits:

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following `CREATE FUNCTION` statement:
    
        CREATE FUNCTION `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.square_area(length FLOAT64)
        RETURNS FLOAT64 LANGUAGE python
        OPTIONS (entry_point='square_area', runtime_version='python-3.11',
        container_memory='CONTAINER_MEMORY', container_cpu=CONTAINER_CPU, container_request_concurrency=CONTAINER_REQUEST_CONCURRENCY)
        AS r"""
        def square_area(length):
          return length*length
        """;
        
        SELECT `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.square_area(4.5);
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - PROJECT\_ID . DATASET\_ID : your project ID and dataset ID.
      - CONTAINER\_MEMORY : the memory value in the following format: `<integer_number><unit>` . The unit must be one of these values: `Mi` (MiB), `M` (MB), `Gi` (GiB), or `G` (GB). For example, `2Gi` .
      - CONTAINER\_CPU : the CPU value. Python UDFs support fractional CPU values between `0.33` and `1.0` and non-fractional CPU values of `1` , `2` , and `4` .
      - CONTAINER\_REQUEST\_CONCURRENCY : the maximum number of concurrent requests per Python UDF container instance. The value must be an integer from `1` to `1000` .

3.  Click play\_circle\_filled **Run** .

### Supported CPU values

Python UDFs support fractional CPU values between `0.33` and `1.0` and non-fractional CPU values of `1` , `2` , and `4` . Containers that run Python UDFs can be configured up to [`4` vCpu](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/user-defined-functions-python#configure-container-limits) . The default value is `1.0` . Fractional input values are rounded to two decimal places before they're applied to the container.

### Supported memory values

Python UDF containers support memory values in the following format: `<integer_number><unit>` . The unit must be one of these values: `Mi` , `M` , `Gi` , `G` . The minimum amount of memory you can configure is `256Mi` . The maximum amount of memory you can configure is `16Gi` .

Based on the memory value you choose, you must also specify an appropriate amount of CPU. The following table shows the minimum and maximum CPU values for each memory value:

| Memory                                               | Minimum CPU | Maximum CPU |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `256Mi` to `512Mi`                                   | `0.33`      | `2`         |
| Greater than `512Mi` and less than or equal to `1Gi` | `0.5`       | `2`         |
| Greater than `1Gi` and less than `2Gi`               | `1`         | `2`         |
| `2Gi` to `4Gi`                                       | `1`         | `4`         |
| Greater than `4Gi` and up to `8Gi`                   | `2`         | `4`         |
| Greater than `8Gi` and up to `16Gi`                  | `4`         | `4`         |

Alternatively, if you've determined the amount of CPU you're allocating, you can use the following table to determine the appropriate memory range:

| CPU                    | Minimum memory | Maximum memory |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Less than `0.5`        | `256Mi`        | `512Mi`        |
| `0.5` to less than `1` | `256Mi`        | `1Gi`          |
| `1`                    | `256Mi`        | `4Gi`          |
| `2`                    | `256Mi`        | `8Gi`          |
| `4`                    | `2Gi`          | `16Gi`         |

## Call Google Cloud or online services in Python code

A Python UDF accesses a Google Cloud service or an external service by using the [Cloud resource connection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection) service account. The connection's service account must be granted permissions to access the service. The permissions required vary depending on the service that is accessed and the APIs that are called from your Python code.

If you create a Python UDF without using a Cloud resource connection, the function is executed in an environment that blocks network access. If your UDF accesses online services, you must create the UDF with a Cloud resource connection. If you don't, the UDF is blocked from accessing the network until an internal connection timeout is reached. When you use a Cloud resource connection, implement the following:

  - Timeouts. When you make network calls within your Python UDF, always include a reasonable timeout. This prevents the UDF from hanging indefinitely if the external service is slow to respond or is unreachable.

  - Use Error Handling. Wrap your network call code in a `try...except` block to gracefully handle potential errors, such as connection errors, timeouts, or HTTP failure status codes. This allows your UDF to return a meaningful error or a fallback value instead of causing the query to fail or stop responding.

The following example shows you how to access the Cloud Translation service from a Python UDF. This example has two projects—a project named `my_query_project` where you create the UDF and the Cloud resource connection, and a project where you are running the Cloud Translation named `my_translate_project` .

### Create a Cloud resource connection

First, you create a Cloud resource connection in `my_query_project` . To create the cloud resource connection, follow these steps.

Select one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    ![Highlighted button for the Explorer pane.](https://docs.cloud.google.com/static/bigquery/images/explorer-tab.png)
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project name, and then click **Connections** .

4.  On the **Connections** page, click **Create connection** .

5.  For **Connection type** , choose **Vertex AI remote models, remote functions, BigLake and Spanner (Cloud Resource)** .

6.  In the **Connection ID** field, enter a name for your connection.

7.  For **Location type** , select a location for your connection. The connection should be colocated with your other resources such as datasets.

8.  Click **Create connection** .

9.  Click **Go to connection** .

10. In the **Connection info** pane, copy the service account ID for use in a later step.

### SQL

Use the [`CREATE CONNECTION` statement](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_connection_statement) :

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
        CREATE CONNECTION [IF NOT EXISTS] `CONNECTION_NAME`
        OPTIONS (
          connection_type = "CLOUD_RESOURCE",
          friendly_name = "FRIENDLY_NAME",
          description = "DESCRIPTION"
          );
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  CONNECTION_NAME  ` : the name of the connection in either the `  PROJECT_ID . LOCATION . CONNECTION_ID  ` , `  LOCATION . CONNECTION_ID  ` , or `  CONNECTION_ID  ` format. If the project or location are omitted, then they are inferred from the project and location where the statement is run.
      - `  FRIENDLY_NAME  ` (optional): a descriptive name for the connection.
      - `  DESCRIPTION  ` (optional): a description of the connection.

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### bq

1.  In a command-line environment, create a connection:
    
        bq mk --connection --location=REGION --project_id=PROJECT_ID \
            --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE CONNECTION_ID
    
    The `--project_id` parameter overrides the default project.
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  REGION  ` : your [connection region](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations#supported_locations)
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your Google Cloud project ID
      - `  CONNECTION_ID  ` : an ID for your connection
    
    When you create a connection resource, BigQuery creates a unique system service account and associates it with the connection.
    
    **Troubleshooting** : If you get the following connection error, [update the Google Cloud SDK](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart) :
    
    ```console
    Flags parsing error: flag --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE: value should be one of...
    ```

2.  Retrieve and copy the service account ID for use in a later step:
    
        bq show --connection PROJECT_ID.REGION.CONNECTION_ID
    
    The output is similar to the following:
    
    ```console
    name                          properties
    1234.REGION.CONNECTION_ID     {"serviceAccountId": "connection-1234-9u56h9@gcp-sa-bigquery-condel.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}
    ```

### Terraform

Use the [`google_bigquery_connection`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/bigquery_connection) resource.

> **Note:** To create BigQuery objects using Terraform, you must enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://docs.cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

The following example creates a Cloud resource connection named `my_cloud_resource_connection` in the `US` region:

```terraform
# This queries the provider for project information.
data "google_project" "default" {}

# This creates a cloud resource connection in the US region named my_cloud_resource_connection.
# Note: The cloud resource nested object has only one output field - serviceAccountId.
resource "google_bigquery_connection" "default" {
  connection_id = "my_cloud_resource_connection"
  project       = data.google_project.default.project_id
  location      = "US"
  cloud_resource {}
}
```

To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.

## Prepare Cloud Shell

1.  Launch [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) .

2.  Set the default Google Cloud project where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
    
    You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
    
        export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PROJECT_ID
    
    Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform configuration file.

## Prepare the directory

Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also called a *root module* ).

1.  In [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) , create a directory and a new file within that directory. The filename must have the `.tf` extension—for example `main.tf` . In this tutorial, the file is referred to as `main.tf` .
    
        mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf

2.  If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
    
    Copy the sample code into the newly created `main.tf` .
    
    Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.

3.  Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.

4.  Save your changes.

5.  Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
    
        terraform init
    
    Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the `-upgrade` option:
    
        terraform init -upgrade

## Apply the changes

1.  Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or update match your expectations:
    
        terraform plan
    
    Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.

2.  Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering `yes` at the prompt:
    
        terraform apply
    
    Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete\!" message.

3.  [Open your Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to view the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure that Terraform has created or updated them.

> **Note:** Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project.

### Grant access to the connection's service account

You need the service account ID you copied previously when you configure permissions for the connection. When you create a connection resource, BigQuery creates a unique system service account and associates it with the connection.

To grant the Cloud resource connection service account access to your projects, grant the service account the [Service usage consumer role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/access-control#serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer) ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` ) in `my_query_project` and the [Cloud Translation API user role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/translate/docs/access-control#cloudtranslate.user) ( `roles/cloudtranslate.user` ) in `my_translate_project` .

### Console

1.  Go to the **IAM** page.

2.  Verify that `my_query_project` is selected.

3.  Click person\_add **Grant Access** .

4.  In the **New principals** field, enter the Cloud resource connection's service account ID that you copied previously.

5.  In the **Select a role** field, choose **Service usage** , and then select **Service usage consumer** .

6.  Click **Save** .

7.  In the project selector, choose **`my_translate_project`** .

8.  Go to the **IAM** page.

9.  Click person\_add **Grant Access** .

10. In the **New principals** field, enter the Cloud resource connection's service account ID that you copied previously.

11. In the **Select a role** field, choose **Cloud translation** , and then select **Cloud Translation API user** .

12. Click **Save** .

### SQL

Use the [`GRANT` statement](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-control-language#grant_statement) to grant the [Service usage consumer role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/access-control#serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer) ( `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer` ) to the service account in `my_query_project` :

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` 
      GRANT `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`
      ON PROJECT `my_query_project`
      TO "connection:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID";
      
    ```
    
    Replace `  SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID  ` with the service account ID you copied previously.

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

Use the [`GRANT` statement](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-control-language#grant_statement) to grant the [Cloud Translation API user role](https://docs.cloud.google.com/translate/docs/access-control#cloudtranslate.user) ( `roles/cloudtranslate.user` ) in `my_translate_project` :

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` 
      GRANT `roles/cloudtranslate.user`
      ON PROJECT `my_translate_project`
      TO "connection:SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID";
      
    ```
    
    Replace `  SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID  ` with the service account ID you copied previously.

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### Create a Python UDF that calls the Cloud Translation service

In `my_query_project` , create a Python UDF that calls the Cloud Translation service using your Cloud resource connection.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  Enter the following `CREATE FUNCTION` statement in the query editor:
    
        CREATE FUNCTION `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.translate_to_es(x STRING)
        RETURNS STRING LANGUAGE python
        WITH CONNECTION `PROJECT_ID.REGION.CONNECTION_ID`
        OPTIONS (entry_point='do_translate', runtime_version='python-3.11', packages=['google-cloud-translate>=3.11', 'google-api-core'])
        AS r"""
        
        from google.api_core.retry import Retry
        from google.cloud import translate
        
        project = "my_translate_project"
        translate_client = translate.TranslationServiceClient()
        
        def do_translate(x : str) -> str:
        
            response = translate_client.translate_text(
                request={
                    "parent": f"projects/PROJECT_ID/locations/us-central1",
                    "contents": [x],
                    "target_language_code": "es",
                    "mime_type": "text/plain",
                },
                retry=Retry(),
            )
            return response.translations[0].translated_text
        
        """;
        
        -- Call the UDF.
        WITH text_table AS
          (SELECT "Hello" AS text
          UNION ALL
          SELECT "Good morning" AS text
          UNION ALL
          SELECT "Goodbye" AS text)
        SELECT text,
        `PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID`.translate_to_es(text) AS translated_text
        FROM text_table;
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID.
      - `  DATASET_ID  ` : the dataset ID.
      - `  REGION  ` : your connection's region.
      - `  CONNECTION_ID  ` : the connection ID.

3.  Click play\_circle\_filled **Run** .
    
    The output should look like the following:
    
        +--------------------------+-------------------------------+
        | text                     | translated_text               |
        +--------------------------+-------------------------------+
        | Hello                    | Hola                          |
        | Good morning             | Buen dia                      |
        | Goodbye                  | Adios                         |
        +--------------------------+-------------------------------+

## Use VPC Service Controls

Python UDFs inherit the VPC Service Controls perimeter of the project that runs the query job. This perimeter protects your jobs from data exfiltration, and it ensures that service interactions are secure.

When you invoke a Python UDF inside the VPC Service Controls perimeter, it has the following network connectivity:

  - Python UDFs that don't use a Cloud resource connection are fully isolated. All outbound traffic is blocked.
  - Python UDFs that use a Cloud resource connection are blocked from public internet access. Python UDFs can only access Google Cloud services that support VPC Service Controls. Outbound traffic to any destination other than `restricted.googleapis.com` is blocked.

### Configure Python UDFs to access Google Cloud services securely within VPC Service Controls

To access Google Cloud services from Python UDFs while enforcing VPC Service Controls, follow these steps:

1.  Create the Python UDF using the [CREATE FUNCTION statement's](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_function_statement) `WITH CONNECTION` clause.
2.  Include the BigQuery project where the query job runs and the target service project in the service perimeter. Alternatively, configure a [perimeter bridge](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/create-perimeter-bridges) .
3.  Add the target service API to the perimeter configuration. For example, `translate.googleapis.com` if you're connecting to the Cloud Translation API.

For more details on configuring a VPC Service Controls perimeter, see:

  - [VPC Service Controls for BigQuery](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/vpc-sc)
  - [Overview of VPC Service Controls](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview)

## Best practices

When you create Python UDFs, follow these best practices:

  - Optimize your query logic for batching. Complex query structures can disable batching. This forces slow, row-by-row processing, which significantly increases latency on large datasets.
  - Optimize the data payload. The size of individual rows can impact the efficiency of the batching feature. Keep each row as small as possible to maximize the number of rows that can be processed in a single batch.
  - Configure [container limits](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/user-defined-functions-python#configure-container-limits) efficiently. Scalability is a function of CPU, memory, and request concurrency. Check monitoring metrics to tune the container configuration. If CPU utilization is high, increase CPU allocation using the `container_cpu` limit, or reduce container request concurrency using the `container_request_concurrency` limit.
  - When you use iterative tuning, start with default values. If performance is suboptimal, analyze monitoring metrics to identify specific bottlenecks.
  - Implement API timeouts. When your Python UDF accesses the internet, set a timeout on the API call to avoid unexpected behavior. An example of internet access is reading from a Cloud Storage bucket.

## View Python UDF metrics

Python UDFs export metrics to Cloud Monitoring. These metrics help you monitor various aspects of your UDF's operational health and resource consumption, providing insights into the performance and behavior of your UDF instances.

### Monitoring resource type

The metrics for Python UDFs are reported under the following Cloud Monitoring resource type:

  - *Type* : `bigquery.googleapis.com/ManagedRoutineInvocation`
  - *Display Name* : BigQuery Managed Routine Invocation
  - *Labels* :
      - `resource_container` : the ID of the project where the query job ran.
      - `location` : the location where the query job ran.
      - `query_job_id` : the ID of the query job that invoked the Python UDF.
      - `routine_project_id` : the project ID where the invoked routine is stored.
      - `routine_dataset_id` : the dataset ID where the invoked routine is stored.
      - `routine_id` : the ID of the invoked routine.

### Metrics

The following metrics are available for the `bigquery.googleapis.com/ManagedRoutineInvocation` resource type:

| Metric                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                               | Unit               | Value type     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| `bigquery.googleapis.com/managed_routine/python/cpu_utilizations`          | When a Python UDF is invoked, this metric shows the distribution of CPU utilization across all Python UDF instances for the query job.    | A percentage value | `DISTRIBUTION` |
| `bigquery.googleapis.com/managed_routine/python/memory_utilizations`       | When a Python UDF is invoked, this metric shows the distribution of memory utilization across all Python UDF instances for the query job. | A percentage value | `DISTRIBUTION` |
| `bigquery.googleapis.com/managed_routine/python/max_request_concurrencies` | This metric shows the distribution of the maximum number of concurrent requests served by each Python UDF instance.                       | Count              | `DISTRIBUTION` |
