# AlloyDB federated queries

As a data analyst, you can query data in AlloyDB for PostgreSQL from BigQuery using [federated queries](/bigquery/docs/federated-queries-intro) .

BigQuery AlloyDB federation lets BigQuery query data residing in AlloyDB in real time without copying or moving the data.

## Before you begin

  - Ensure that your BigQuery administrator has created an [AlloyDB connection](/bigquery/docs/connect-to-alloydb#create-alloydb-connection) and [shared](/bigquery/docs/connect-to-alloydb#share_connections) it with you.

  - To get the permissions that you need to query an AlloyDB instance, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Connection User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.connectionUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.connectionUser  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Query data

To send a federated query to AlloyDB from a GoogleSQL query, use the [`  EXTERNAL_QUERY  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/federated_query_functions#external_query) .

Suppose that you store a customer table in BigQuery, while storing a sales table in AlloyDB, and want to join the two tables in a single query. The following example makes a federated query to an AlloyDB table named `  orders  ` and joins the results with a BigQuery table named `  mydataset.customers  ` .

The example query includes 3 parts:

1.  Run the external query `  SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id  ` in the AlloyDB database to get the first order date for each customer through the `  EXTERNAL_QUERY  ` function.

2.  Join the external query results table with the customers table in BigQuery by `  customer_id  ` .

3.  Select customer information and first order date in the final result set.

<!-- end list -->

``` text
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, rq.first_order_date
FROM mydataset.customers AS c
LEFT OUTER JOIN EXTERNAL_QUERY(
  'us.connection_id',
  '''SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id''') AS rq ON rq.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, rq.first_order_date;
```

## View an AlloyDB table schema

You can use the `  EXTERNAL_QUERY  ` function to query `  information_schema  ` tables to access database metadata. For example, you can list all of the tables in the database or view the table schema. For more information, see [PostgreSQL information\_schema tables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/information-schema.html) .

``` text
-- List all tables in a database.
SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL_QUERY("region.connection_id",
"select * from information_schema.tables;");
```

``` text
-- List all columns in a table.
SELECT * FROM EXTERNAL_QUERY("region.connection_id",
"select * from information_schema.columns where table_name='x';");
```

## Track BigQuery federated queries

When you run a federated query against AlloyDB, BigQuery annotates the query with a comment similar to the following:

``` text
/* Federated query from BigQuery. Project ID: PROJECT_ID, BigQuery Job ID: JOB_ID. */
```

If you are monitoring logs for query usage, the following annotation can help you identify queries coming from BigQuery.

1.  Go to the **Logs Explorer** page.

2.  In the **Query** tab, enter the following query:
    
    ``` text
    resource.type="alloydb.googleapis.com/Instance"
    textPayload=~"Federated query from BigQuery"
    ```

3.  Click **Run query** .
    
    If there are records available for BigQuery federated queries, a list of records similar to the following appears in **Query results** .
    
    ``` text
    YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.millis UTC [3210064]: [4-1]
    db=DATABASE, user=USER_ACCOUNT
    STATEMENT: SELECT 1 FROM (SELECT FROM company_name_table) t;
    /* Federated query from BigQuery.
    Project ID: PROJECT_ID, BigQuery Job ID: JOB_ID
    */
    
    YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss.millis UTC [3210532]: [2-1]
    db=DATABASE, user=USER_ACCOUNT
    STATEMENT: SELECT "company_id", "company type_id" FROM
    (SELECT FROM company_name_table) t;
    /* Federated query from BigQuery.
    Project ID: PROJECT_ID, BigQuery Job ID: JOB_ID
    */
    ```

## Troubleshooting

This section describes potential errors you might encounter when sending a federated query to AlloyDB and provides possible troubleshooting resolutions.

**Issue:** Failed to connect to the database server with this error: `  Invalid table-valued function EXTERNAL_QUERY Connect to PostgreSQL server failed: server closed the connection unexpectedly. This probably means the server terminated abnormally before or while processing the request.  `

**Resolution:** Ensure that you used valid credentials and followed all prerequisites while creating the [connection to AlloyDB](/bigquery/docs/connect-to-alloydb#create-alloydb-connection) . Check if the service account that is automatically created when a connection to AlloyDB is created has the AlloyDB Client ( `  roles/alloydb.client  ` ) role. For more information, see [Grant access to the service account](/bigquery/docs/connect-to-alloydb#access-alloydb) .
