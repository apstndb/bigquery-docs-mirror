# Tutorial: Run inference on an object table by using a classification model

This tutorial shows you how to create an object table based on the images from a public dataset, and then run inference on that object table using the [ResNet 50 model](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/resnet_50/classification/1) .

## The ResNet 50 model

The ResNet 50 model analyzes image files and outputs a batch of vectors representing the likelihood that an image belongs the corresponding class (logits). For more information, see the **Usage** section on the [model's TensorFlow Hub page](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/resnet_50/classification/1) .

The ResNet 50 model input takes a tensor of [`  DType  `](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/dtypes/DType) = `  float32  ` in the shape `  [-1, 224, 224, 3]  ` . The output is an array of tensors of `  tf.float32  ` in the shape `  [-1, 1024]  ` .

## Required permissions

  - To create the dataset, you need the `  bigquery.datasets.create  ` permission.

  - To create the connection resource, you need the following permissions:
    
      - `  bigquery.connections.create  `
      - `  bigquery.connections.get  `

  - To grant permissions to the connection's service account, you need the following permission:
    
      - `  resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy  `

  - To create the object table, you need the following permissions:
    
      - `  bigquery.tables.create  `
      - `  bigquery.tables.update  `
      - `  bigquery.connections.delegate  `

  - To create the bucket, you need the `  storage.buckets.create  ` permission.

  - To upload the model to Cloud Storage, you need the `  storage.objects.create  ` and `  storage.objects.get  ` permissions.

  - To load the model into BigQuery ML, you need the following permissions:
    
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `
      - `  bigquery.models.create  `
      - `  bigquery.models.getData  `
      - `  bigquery.models.updateData  `

  - To run inference, you need the following permissions:
    
      - `  bigquery.tables.getData  ` on the object table
      - `  bigquery.models.getData  ` on the model
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

## Costs

In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:

  - **BigQuery** : You incur storage costs for the object table you create in BigQuery.
  - **BigQuery ML** : You incur costs for the model you create and the inference you perform in BigQuery ML.
  - **Cloud Storage** : You incur costs for the objects you store in Cloud Storage.

## Upload the model to Cloud Storage

Get the model files and make them available in Cloud Storage:

1.  [Download](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/resnet_50/classification/1?tf-hub-format=compressed) the ResNet 50 model to your local machine. This gives you a `  saved_model.pb  ` file and a `  variables  ` folder for the model.
2.  [Upload](/storage/docs/uploading-objects) the `  saved_model.pb  ` file and the `  variables  ` folder to the bucket you previously created.

## Load the model into BigQuery ML

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the **Editor** pane, run the following SQL statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE MODEL `resnet_inference_test.resnet`
    OPTIONS(
      model_type = 'TENSORFLOW',
      model_path = 'gs://BUCKET_NAME/*');
    ```
    
    Replace `  BUCKET_NAME  ` with the name of the bucket you previously created.

## Inspect the model

Inspect the uploaded model to see what its input and output fields are:

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then click the `  resnet_inference_test  ` dataset.

4.  Go to the **Models** tab.

5.  Click the `  resnet  ` model.

6.  In the model pane that opens, click the **Schema** tab.

7.  Look at the **Labels** section. This identifies the fields that are output by the model. In this case, the field name value is `  activation_49  ` .

8.  Look at the **Features** section. This identifies the fields that must be input into the model. You reference them in the `  SELECT  ` statement for the `  ML.DECODE_IMAGE  ` function. In this case, the field name value is `  input_1  ` .

## Run inference

Run inference on the `  vision_images  ` object table using the `  resnet  ` model:

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the **Editor** pane, run the following SQL statement:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT *
    FROM ML.PREDICT(
      MODEL `resnet_inference_test.resnet`,
      (SELECT uri, ML.RESIZE_IMAGE(ML.DECODE_IMAGE(data), 224, 224, FALSE) AS input_1
      FROM resnet_inference_test.vision_images)
    );
    ```
    
    The results should look similar to the following:
    
    ``` text

## Clean up

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `  appspot.com  ` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
