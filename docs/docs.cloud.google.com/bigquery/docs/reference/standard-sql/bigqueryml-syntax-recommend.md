# The ML.RECOMMEND function

This document describes the `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` function, which lets you generate a predicted rating for every user-item row combination for a [matrix factorization model](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-matrix-factorization) . Because the input data for a matrix factorization model tends to be a sparse matrix with missing values, `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` can return the predictions for those missing values without requiring specification of each entry.

**Note:** `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` can generate large outputs. Consider saving the output to a table for analysis.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.RECOMMEND(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL_NAME`,
  [, { TABLE `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.TABLE` | (QUERY_STATEMENT) }]
  [, STRUCT(TRIAL_ID AS trial_id)])
```

### Arguments

`  ML.RECOMMEND  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the project that contains the resource.

  - `  DATASET  ` : the dataset that contains the resource.

  - `  MODEL  ` : the name of the model.

  - `  TABLE  ` : The name of the input table that contains the user and item data.
    
    If you specify input data by using either the `  TABLE  ` or `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` argument, the user and item columns must match the user and item columns in the model, and their types must be compatible according to BigQuery [implicit coercion rules](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conversion_rules#coercion) .
    
    If the input table does not contain both the user and item column, the input table can only contain one column. If the table contains both the user and item columns, then the non-user or item columns are passed through and available for use in the query.

  - `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` : The GoogleSQL query that is used to generate the evaluation data. For the supported SQL syntax for the `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` clause in GoogleSQL, see [Query syntax](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#sql_syntax) .
    
    If you specify input data by using either the `  TABLE  ` or `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` argument, the user and item columns must match the user and item columns in the model, and their types must be compatible according to BigQuery [implicit coercion rules](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conversion_rules#coercion) .

  - `  TRIAL_ID  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that identifies the hyperparameter tuning trial that you want the function to evaluate. The function uses the optimal trial by default. Only specify this argument if you ran hyperparameter tuning when creating the model.

## Output

`  ML.RECOMMEND  ` outputs at least 3 columns for all cases; the `  user  ` column, the `  item  ` column and a column for predicted recommendations.

The output of `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` is computed as follows:

  - If both the user and item columns are in the input data, then `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` returns a rating for each user-item pair.
  - If only the user or only the item is specified (for example, if the table identified by the `  table  ` argument only contains the user column), then all the item ratings for every user in the table are outputted.
  - If either the user or item feature was not in the training dataset, the rating that is returned is the intercept of the feature that was provided, either item or user, added to the `  global__intercept__  ` offset. For example, `  global__intercept__ + __intercept__['user_a']  ` .
  - If input data is specified but does not provide either the user or item column, `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` returns an error.
  - If no input data is specified, `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` outputs the ratings for every user and item combination seen during training.

If the model was trained with `  feedback_type=EXPLICIT  ` , a user column called `  user  ` , and an item column called `  item  ` , then `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  user  ` : a `  STRING  ` value containing the user data.
  - `  item  ` : a `  STRING  ` value containing the item data
  - `  predicted_<rating_col_name>  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the rating for each user-item pair. Because the input ratings from training are assumed to be explicit feedback, the predicted ratings are approximately in the range of the original input, although ratings outside the range are also normal.

If the model was trained with `  feedback_type=IMPLICIT  ` , a user column called `  user  ` , and an item column called `  item  ` , then `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  user  ` : a `  STRING  ` value containing the user data.
  - `  item  ` : a `  STRING  ` value containing the item data
  - `  predicted_<rating_col_name>_confidence  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the relative confidence for each user-item pair. The input ratings from training are assumed to be a proxy for user confidence. Therefore, if the model has converged, the predicted confidences lie between approximately 0 and 1 (but can lie just outside that range). If the model hasn't converged, the predicted confidences can be any value. If your model isn't converging and your ratings are very large, try decreasing the `  WALS_ALPHA  ` value that's specified in the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement for the model. If your model isn't converging and your ratings are very small, try increasing the `  WALS_ALPHA  ` value.

## Examples

The following examples show how to use the `  ML.RECOMMEND  ` function.

### No input data

The following example generates predicted ratings for every user-item pair in the inputs of `  mymodel  ` because there is no input data specified.

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.RECOMMEND(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`)
```

### With input data

The following example generates predicted ratings for each user-item row in `  mydataset.mytable  ` assuming that `  mydataset.mymodel  ` was trained using the user column `  user  ` and item column `  item  ` .

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.RECOMMEND(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`,
      (
      SELECT
        user,
        item
      FROM
        `mydataset.mytable`))
```
