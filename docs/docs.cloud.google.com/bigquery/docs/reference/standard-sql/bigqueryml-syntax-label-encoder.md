# The ML.LABEL\_ENCODER function

This document describes the `  ML.LABEL_ENCODER  ` function, which you can use to encode a string expression to an `  INT64  ` value in `  [0, <number of categories>]  ` .

The encoding vocabulary is sorted alphabetically. `  NULL  ` values and categories that aren't in the vocabulary are encoded to `  0  ` .

When used in the [`  TRANSFORM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform) , the vocabulary values calculated during training, along with the top *k* and frequency threshold values that you specified, are automatically used in prediction.

You can use this function with models that support [manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) . For more information, see the following documents:

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.LABEL_ENCODER(string_expression [, top_k] [, frequency_threshold]) OVER()
```

`  ML.LABEL_ENCODER  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  string_expression  ` : the `  STRING  ` expression to encode.
  - `  top_k  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies the number of categories included in the encoding vocabulary. The function selects the `  top_k  ` most frequent categories in the data and uses those; categories below this threshold are encoded to `  0  ` . This value must be less than `  1,000,000  ` to avoid problems due to high dimensionality. The default value is `  32,000  ` .
  - `  frequency_threshold  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that limits the categories included in the encoding vocabulary based on category frequency. The function uses categories whose frequency is greater than or equal to `  frequency_threshold  ` ; categories below this threshold are encoded to `  0  ` . The default value is `  5  ` .

## Output

`  ML.LABEL_ENCODER  ` returns an `  INT64  ` value that represents the encoded string expression.

## Example

The following example performs label encoding on a set of string expressions. It limits the encoding vocabulary to the two categories that occur the most frequently in the data and that also occur two or more times.

``` text
SELECT f, ML.LABEL_ENCODER(f, 2, 2) OVER () AS output
FROM UNNEST([NULL, 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'd']) AS f
ORDER BY f;
```

The output looks similar to the following:

``` console
+------+--------+
|  f   | output |
+------+--------+
| NULL |      0 |
| a    |      0 |
| b    |      1 |
| b    |      1 |
| c    |      2 |
| c    |      2 |
| c    |      2 |
| d    |      0 |
| d    |      0 |
+------+--------+
```
