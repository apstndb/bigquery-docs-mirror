# The ML.CONVERT\_COLOR\_SPACE function

This document describes the `  ML.CONVERT_COLOR_SPACE  ` scalar function, which lets you convert images that have an `  RGB  ` color space to a different color space. You can use `  ML.CONVERT_COLOR_SPACE  ` with the [`  ML.PREDICT  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-predict) or chain it with other functions or subqueries.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.CONVERT_COLOR_SPACE(image, target_color_space)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.CONVERT_COLOR_SPACE  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  image  ` : a `  STRUCT  ` value that represents an `  RGB  ` image in one of the following forms:
    
      - `  STRUCT<ARRAY<INT64>, ARRAY<FLOAT64>>  `
      - `  STRUCT<ARRAY<INT64>, ARRAY<INT64>>  `
    
    The first array in the struct must contain the dimensions of the image. It must contain three `  INT64  ` values, which represent the image height (H), width (W), and number of channels (C).
    
    The second array in the struct must contain the image data. The length of the array must be equivalent to H x W x C from the preceding array. If the image data is in `  FLOAT64  ` , each value in the array must be between `  [0, 1)  ` . If the image data is in `  INT64  ` , each value in the array must be between `  [0, 255)  ` .
    
    The struct value must be \<= 60 MB.

  - `  target_color_space  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that specifies the target color space. Valid values are `  HSV  ` , `  GRAYSCALE  ` , `  YIQ  ` , and `  YUV  ` .

## Output

`  ML.CONVERT_COLOR_SPACE  ` returns a `  STRUCT  ` value that represents the modified image in the form `  STRUCT<ARRAY<INT64>, ARRAY<FLOAT64>>  ` .

The first array in the struct represents the dimensions of the image, and the second array in the struct contains the image data, similar to the `  image  ` input argument. Each value in the second array is between `  [0, 1)  ` .

**Note:** If you reference `  ML.CONVERT_COLOR_SPACE  ` in SQL statements in the BigQuery editor, it is possible for the function output to be too large to display. If this occurs, write the output to a table instead.

## Example

The following example uses the `  ML.CONVERT_COLOR_SPACE  ` function within the `  ML.PREDICT  ` function to change the color space for input images from `  RGB  ` to `  GRAYSCALE  ` :

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE mydataset.model_output
AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM
    ML.PREDICT(
      MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`,
      SELECT
        ML.CONVERT_COLOR_SPACE(ML.DECODE_IMAGE(data), 'GRAYSCALE')
          AS image,
        uri
      FROM `mydataset.images`)
);
```
