# The ML.CONVERT\_IMAGE\_TYPE function

This document describes the `  ML.CONVERT_IMAGE_TYPE  ` scalar function, which lets you convert the data type of pixel values in an image to `  INT64  ` with a range of `  [0, 255)  ` . You can use `  ML.CONVERT_IMAGE_TYPE  ` with the [`  ML.PREDICT  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-predict) or chain it with other functions or subqueries.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.CONVERT_IMAGE_TYPE(image)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.CONVERT_IMAGE_TYPE  ` takes the following argument:

  - `  image  ` : a `  STRUCT<ARRAY<INT64>, ARRAY<FLOAT64>>  ` value that represents an image.
    
    The first array in the struct must contain the dimensions of the image. It must contain three `  INT64  ` values, which represent the image height (H), width (W), and number of channels (C).
    
    The second array in the struct must contain the image data. The length of the array must be equivalent to H x W x C from the preceding array. Each value in the array must be between `  [0, 1)  ` .
    
    The struct value must be \<= 60 MB.

## Output

`  ML.CONVERT_IMAGE_TYPE  ` returns a `  STRUCT<ARRAY<INT64>, ARRAY<INT64>>  ` value that represents the image.

The first array in the struct represents the dimensions of the image, and the second array in the struct contains the image data, similar to the `  image  ` input argument. Each value in the second array is between `  [0, 255)  ` .

**Note:** If you reference `  ML.CONVERT_IMAGE_TYPE  ` in SQL statements in the BigQuery editor, it is possible for the function output to be too large to display. If this occurs, write the output to a table instead.

## Example

The [SSD Mobilenet V2 Object detection model](https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/ssd_mobilenet_v2/2) model requires input to be in `  tf.uint8  ` . The following example changes the pixel values for the input images from floating point numbers to integers so that they work with this model:

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE mydataset.detections
AS (
  SELECT uri, detection_scores
  FROM
    ML.PREDICT(
      MODEL `mydataset.mobilenet`,
      SELECT
        ML.CONVERT_IMAGE_TYPE(ML.DECODE_IMAGE(data))
          AS image,
        uri
      FROM `mydataset.images`)
);
```
