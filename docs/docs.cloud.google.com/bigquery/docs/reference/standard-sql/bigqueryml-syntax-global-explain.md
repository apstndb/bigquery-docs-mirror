# The ML.GLOBAL\_EXPLAIN function

This document describes the `  ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN  ` function, which lets you provide explanations for the entire model by aggregating the local explanations of the evaluation data. You can only use `  ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN  ` with models that are trained with the [`  ENABLE_GLOBAL_EXPLAIN  ` option](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#enable_global_explain) set to `  TRUE  ` .

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL`,
  STRUCT(
    [CLASS_LEVEL_EXPLAIN AS class_level_explain]))
```

### Arguments

`  ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID.

  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the model.

  - `  MODEL  ` : the name of the model.

  - `  CLASS_LEVEL_EXPLAIN  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that specifies whether global feature importances are returned for each class. Applies only to non-AutoML Tables classification models. When set to `  FALSE  ` , the global feature importance of the entire model is returned rather than that of each class. The default value is `  FALSE  ` .
    
    Regression models and AutoML Tables classification models only have model-level global feature importance.

## Output

The output of `  ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN  ` has two formats:

  - For classification models with `  class_level_explain  ` set to `  FALSE  ` , and for regression models, the following columns are returned:
    
      - `  feature  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the feature name.
      - `  attribution  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the feature importance to the model overall.

  - For classification models with `  class_level_explain  ` set to `  TRUE  ` , the following columns are returned:
    
      - `  <class_name>  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the name of the class in the label column.
      - `  feature  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the feature name.
      - `  attribution  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the feature importance to this class.
    
    For each class, only the top 10 most important features are returned.

## Examples

The following examples assume your model is in your default project.

### Regression model

This example gets global feature importance for the boosted tree regression model `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` . The dataset is in your default project.

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`)
```

### Classifier model

This example gets global feature importance for the boosted tree classifier model `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` . The dataset is in your default project.

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`, STRUCT(TRUE AS class_level_explain))
```
