# The ML.TRAINING\_INFO function

This document describes the `  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` function, which lets you see information about the training iterations of a model.

You can run `  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` while the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement for the target model is running, or you can wait until after the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement completes. If you run `  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` before the first training iteration of the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement completes, the query returns a `  Not found  ` error.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.TRAINING_INFO(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL_NAME`,
)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the model.
  - `  MODEL_NAME  ` : the name of the model.

## Output

`  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  training_run  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the training run identifier for the model. The value in this column is `  0  ` for a newly created model. If you retrain the model using the `  warm_start  ` argument of the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement, this value is incremented.

  - `  iteration  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the iteration number of the training run. The value for the first iteration is `  0  ` . This value is incremented for each additional training run.

  - `  loss  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the loss metric calculated after an iteration on the training data:
    
      - For logistic regression models, this is [log loss](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#Log_Loss) .
      - For linear regression models, this is [mean squared error](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#MSE) .
      - For multiclass logistic regressions, this is [cross-entropy log loss](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#cross-entropy) .
      - For explicit matrix factorization models this is mean squared error calculated over the seen input ratings.
      - For implicit matrix factorization models, the loss is calculated using the following formula:
    
    $$ Loss = \\sum\_{u, i} c\_{ui}(p\_{ui} - x^T\_uy\_i)^2 + \\lambda(\\sum\_u||x\_u||^2 + \\sum\_i||y\_i||^2) $$
    
    For more information about what the variables mean, see [Feedback types](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-matrix-factorization#feedback-info) .

  - `  eval_loss  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the loss metric calculated on the holdout data. For k-means models, `  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` doesn't return an `  eval_loss  ` column. If the [`  DATA_SPLIT_METHOD  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#data_split_method) argument is `  NO_SPLIT  ` , then all entries in the `  eval_loss  ` column are `  NULL  ` .

  - `  learning_rate  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the [learning rate](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#learning_rate) in this iteration.

  - `  duration_ms  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains how long the iteration took, in milliseconds.

  - `  cluster_info  ` : an `  ARRAY<STRUCT>  ` value that contains the fields `  centroid_id  ` , `  cluster_radius  ` , and `  cluster_size  ` . `  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` computes `  cluster_radius  ` and `  cluster_size  ` with standardized features. Only returned for k-means models.

**Note:** For linear and logistic regression models, the `  learning_rate  ` value can increase over the course of training if the [`  LEARN_RATE_STRATEGY  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#learn_rate_strategy) argument isn't set to `  CONSTANT  ` . This increase is due to the fact that when the `  LEARN_RATE_STRATEGY  ` is set to `  LINE_SEARCH  ` , four learning rates are generated from [`  LS_INIT_LEARN_RATE  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#ls_init_learn_rate) . For example, if `  LS_INIT_LEARN_RATE  ` is `  0.1  ` , then the first iteration of training compares the respective loss from a set of four different models trained from setting the learn rate to `  0.2  ` , `  0.1  ` , `  0.05  ` , and `  0.025  ` . If `  LEARN_RATE=0.2  ` generates the model with the smallest loss, then the next iteration generates four models with the learning rate set to `  0.4  ` , `  0.2  ` , `  0.1  ` , `  0.05  ` from the previous best fit model, and this process continues until the model converges.

## Permissions

You must have the `  bigquery.models.create  ` and `  bigquery.models.getData  ` [Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bq-permissions) in order to run `  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` .

## Limitations

`  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` is subject to the following limitations:

  - `  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` doesn't support [imported TensorFlow models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-tensorflow) .
  - For [time series models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-time-series) , `  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` only returns three columns: `  training_run  ` , `  iteration  ` , and `  duration_ms  ` . It doesn't expose the training information per iteration, or per time series if multiple time series are forecasted at once. The `  duration_ms  ` is the total time cost for the entire process.

## Example

The following example retrieves training information from the model `  mydataset.mymodel  ` in your default project:

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.TRAINING_INFO(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`)
```
