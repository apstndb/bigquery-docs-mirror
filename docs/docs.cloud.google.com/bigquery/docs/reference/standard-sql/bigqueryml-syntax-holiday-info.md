# The ML.HOLIDAY\_INFO function

This document describes the `  ML.HOLIDAY_INFO  ` function, which you can use to return the list of holidays being modeled by an [`  ARIMA_PLUS  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-time-series) or [`  ARIMA_PLUS_XREG  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-time-series) time series forecasting model.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.HOLIDAY_INFO(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL_NAME`
)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.HOLIDAY_INFO  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the model.
  - `  MODEL_NAME  ` : the name of the model.

## Output

`  ML.HOLIDAY_INFO  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  region  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that identifies the holiday region.
  - `  holiday_name  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that identifies the holiday.
  - `  primary_date  ` : a `  DATE  ` value that identifies the date the holiday falls on.
  - `  preholiday_days  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that identifies the start of the holiday window around the holiday that was taken into account when modeling.
  - `  postholiday_days  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that identifies the end of the holiday window around the holiday that was taken into account when modeling.

## Example

The following example returns the results for a model that uses a [custom holiday](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-time-series#custom_holidays) :

``` text
SELECT * FROM
ML.HOLIDAY_INFO(MODEL `mydataset.arima_model`);
```

The output looks similar to the following:

``` console
+-----------------------+--------------+-----------------+------------------+
| region | holiday_name | primary_date | preholiday_days | postholiday_days |
+--------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| US     | Members day  | 2001-10-21   | 3               | 1                |
+-----------------------+--------------+-----------------+------------------+
| US     | Members day  | 2002-10-22   | 3               | 1                |
+-----------------------+--------------+-----------------+------------------+
| US     | Members day  | 2003-10-21   | 3               | 1                |
+-----------------------+--------------+-----------------+------------------+
| US     | Members day  | 2004-10-23   | 3               | 1                |
+-----------------------+--------------+-----------------+------------------+
```

## Limitation

  - Results returned by `  ML.HOLIDAY_INFO  ` only indicate the holiday information used during model fitting. They don't necessarily indicate the detection of a holiday effect. Use [`  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-explain-forecast) instead for actual holiday effect results.
