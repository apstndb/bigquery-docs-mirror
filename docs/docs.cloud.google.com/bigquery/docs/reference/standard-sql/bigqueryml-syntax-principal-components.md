# The ML.PRINCIPAL\_COMPONENTS function

This document describes the `  ML.PRINCIPAL_COMPONENTS  ` function, which lets you see the principal components of a principal component analysis (PCA) model. Principal components and [eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors) are the same concepts in PCA models.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.PRINCIPAL_COMPONENTS(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL`
)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.PRINCIPAL_COMPONENTS  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the model.
  - `  MODEL  ` : the name of the model.

## Output

`  ML.PRINCIPAL_COMPONENTS  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  principal_component_id  ` : an `  INT64  ` that contains the principal component ID.

  - `  feature  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the feature column name.

  - `  numerical_value  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the feature value for the principal component that `  principal_component_id  ` identifies if the column identified by the `  feature  ` value is numeric. Otherwise, `  numerical_value  ` is `  NULL  ` .

  - `  categorical_value  ` : an `  ARRAY<STRUCT>  ` value that contains information about categorical features. Each struct contains the following fields:
    
      - `  categorical_value.category  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the name of each category.
      - `  categorical_value.value  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the value of `  categorical_value.category  ` for the principal component that `  principal_component_id  ` identifies.

The output is in descending order by the eigenvalues of the principal components, which you can get by using the [`  ML.PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT_INFO  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-principal-component-info) .

## Example

The following example retrieves the principal components from the model `  mydataset.mymodel  ` in your default project:

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.PRINCIPAL_COMPONENTS(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`)
```
