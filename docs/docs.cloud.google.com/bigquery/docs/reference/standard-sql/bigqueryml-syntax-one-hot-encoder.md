# The ML.ONE\_HOT\_ENCODER function

This document describes the `  ML.ONE_HOT_ENCODER  ` function, which lets you encode a string expression using a [one-hot](/bigquery/docs/auto-preprocessing#one_hot_encoding) or [dummy](/bigquery/docs/auto-preprocessing#dummy_encoding) encoding scheme.

The encoding vocabulary is sorted alphabetically. `  NULL  ` values and categories that aren't in the vocabulary are encoded with an `  index  ` value of `  0  ` . If you use dummy encoding, the dropped category is encoded with a `  value  ` of `  0  ` .

When used in the [`  TRANSFORM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform) , the vocabulary and dropped category values calculated during training, along with the top *k* and frequency threshold values that you specified, are automatically used in prediction.

You can use this function with models that support [manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) . For more information, see the following documents:

  - [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey)
  - [Contribution analysis user journey](/bigquery/docs/contribution-analysis#contribution_analysis_user_journey)

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.ONE_HOT_ENCODER(string_expression [, drop] [, top_k] [, frequency_threshold]) OVER()
```

### Arguments

`  ML.ONE_HOT_ENCODER  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  string_expression  ` : the `  STRING  ` expression to encode.
  - `  drop  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that specifies whether the function drops a category. Valid values are as follows:
      - `  none  ` : Retain all categories. This is the default value.
      - `  most_frequent  ` : Drop the most frequent category found in the string expression. Selecting this value causes the function to use dummy encoding.
  - `  top_k  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies the number of categories included in the encoding vocabulary. The function selects the `  top_k  ` most frequent categories in the data and uses those; categories below this threshold are encoded to `  0  ` . This value must be less than `  1,000,000  ` to avoid problems due to high dimensionality. The default value is `  32,000  ` .
  - `  frequency_threshold  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that limits the categories included in the encoding vocabulary based on category frequency. The function uses categories whose frequency is greater than or equal to `  frequency_threshold  ` ; categories below this threshold are encoded to `  0  ` . The default value is `  5  ` .

## Output

`  ML.ONE_HOT_ENCODER  ` returns an array of struct values, in the form `  ARRAY<STRUCT<INT64, FLOAT64>>  ` . The first element in the struct provides the index of the encoded string expression, and the second element provides the value of the encoded string expression.

## Example

The following example performs dummy encoding on a set of string expressions. It limits the encoding vocabulary to the ten categories that occur the most frequently in the data and that also occur zero or more times.

``` text
SELECT f, ML.ONE_HOT_ENCODER(f, 'most_frequent', 10, 0) OVER () AS output
FROM UNNEST([NULL, 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'd']) AS f
ORDER BY f;
```

The output looks similar to the following:

``` console
+------+-----------------------------+
|  f   | output.index | output.value |
+------+--------------+--------------+
| NULL |  0           |  1.0         |
| a    |  1           |  1.0         |
| b    |  2           |  1.0         |
| b    |  2           |  1.0         |
| c    |  3           |  0.0         |
| c    |  3           |  0.0         |
| c    |  3           |  0.0         |
| d    |  4           |  1.0         |
| d    |  4           |  1.0         |
+------+-----------------------------+
```
