## `     AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES    `

``` text
AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES(keyset, ciphertext, additional_data)
```

**Description**

Uses the matching key from `  keyset  ` to decrypt `  ciphertext  ` and verifies the integrity of the data using `  additional_data  ` . Returns an error if decryption or verification fails.

`  keyset  ` is a serialized `  BYTES  ` value returned by one of the `  KEYS  ` functions or a `  STRUCT  ` returned by `  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN  ` . `  keyset  ` must contain the key that was used to encrypt `  ciphertext  ` , and the key must be in an `  'ENABLED'  ` state, or else the function returns an error. `  AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES  ` identifies the matching key in `  keyset  ` by finding the key with the key ID that matches the one encrypted in `  ciphertext  ` .

`  ciphertext  ` is a `  BYTES  ` value that's the result of a call to `  AEAD.ENCRYPT  ` where the input `  plaintext  ` was of type `  BYTES  ` .

If `  ciphertext  ` includes an initialization vector (IV), it should be the first bytes of `  ciphertext  ` . If `  ciphertext  ` includes an authentication tag, it should be the last bytes of `  ciphertext  ` . If the IV and authentic tag are one (SIV), it should be the first bytes of `  ciphertext  ` . The IV and authentication tag commonly require 16 bytes, but may vary in size.

`  additional_data  ` is a `  STRING  ` or `  BYTES  ` value that binds the ciphertext to its context. This forces the ciphertext to be decrypted in the same context in which it was encrypted. This function casts any `  STRING  ` value to `  BYTES  ` . This must be the same as the `  additional_data  ` provided to `  AEAD.ENCRYPT  ` to encrypt `  ciphertext  ` , ignoring its type, or else the function returns an error.

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

This example creates a table of unique IDs with associated plaintext values and keysets. Then it uses these keysets to encrypt the plaintext values as `  BYTES  ` and store them in a new table. Finally, it uses `  AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES  ` to decrypt the encrypted values and display them as plaintext.

The following statement creates a table `  CustomerKeysets  ` containing a column of unique IDs, a column of `  AEAD_AES_GCM_256  ` keysets, and a column of favorite animals.

``` text
CREATE TABLE aead.CustomerKeysets AS
SELECT
  1 AS customer_id,
  KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256') AS keyset,
  b'jaguar' AS favorite_animal
UNION ALL
SELECT
  2 AS customer_id,
  KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256') AS keyset,
  b'zebra' AS favorite_animal
UNION ALL
SELECT
  3 AS customer_id,
  KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256') AS keyset,
  b'nautilus' AS favorite_animal;
```

The following statement creates a table `  EncryptedCustomerData  ` containing a column of unique IDs and a column of ciphertext. The statement encrypts the plaintext `  favorite_animal  ` using the keyset value from `  CustomerKeysets  ` corresponding to each unique ID.

``` text
CREATE TABLE aead.EncryptedCustomerData AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  AEAD.ENCRYPT(keyset, favorite_animal, CAST(CAST(customer_id AS STRING) AS BYTES))
   AS encrypted_animal
FROM
  aead.CustomerKeysets AS ck;
```

The following query uses the keysets in the `  CustomerKeysets  ` table to decrypt data in the `  EncryptedCustomerData  ` table.

``` text
SELECT
  ecd.customer_id,
  AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES(
    (SELECT ck.keyset
     FROM aead.CustomerKeysets AS ck
     WHERE ecd.customer_id = ck.customer_id),
    ecd.encrypted_animal,
    CAST(CAST(customer_id AS STRING) AS BYTES)
  ) AS favorite_animal
FROM aead.EncryptedCustomerData AS ecd;
```

## `     AEAD.DECRYPT_STRING    `

``` text
AEAD.DECRYPT_STRING(keyset, ciphertext, additional_data)
```

**Description**

Like [`  AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES  `](#aeaddecrypt_bytes) , but where `  additional_data  ` is of type `  STRING  ` .

**Return Data Type**

`  STRING  `

## `     AEAD.ENCRYPT    `

``` text
AEAD.ENCRYPT(keyset, plaintext, additional_data)
```

**Description**

Encrypts `  plaintext  ` using the primary cryptographic key in `  keyset  ` . The algorithm of the primary key must be `  AEAD_AES_GCM_256  ` . Binds the ciphertext to the context defined by `  additional_data  ` . Returns `  NULL  ` if any input is `  NULL  ` .

`  keyset  ` is a serialized `  BYTES  ` value returned by one of the `  KEYS  ` functions or a `  STRUCT  ` returned by `  KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN  ` .

`  plaintext  ` is the `  STRING  ` or `  BYTES  ` value to be encrypted.

`  additional_data  ` is a `  STRING  ` or `  BYTES  ` value that binds the ciphertext to its context. This forces the ciphertext to be decrypted in the same context in which it was encrypted. `  plaintext  ` and `  additional_data  ` must be of the same type. `  AEAD.ENCRYPT(keyset, string1, string2)  ` is equivalent to `  AEAD.ENCRYPT(keyset, CAST(string1 AS BYTES), CAST(string2 AS BYTES))  ` .

The output is ciphertext `  BYTES  ` . The ciphertext contains a [Tink-specific](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/docs/KEY-MANAGEMENT.md) prefix indicating the key used to perform the encryption.

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

The following query uses the keysets for each `  customer_id  ` in the `  CustomerKeysets  ` table to encrypt the value of the plaintext `  favorite_animal  ` in the `  PlaintextCustomerData  ` table corresponding to that `  customer_id  ` . The output contains a column of `  customer_id  ` values and a column of corresponding ciphertext output as `  BYTES  ` .

``` text
WITH CustomerKeysets AS (
  SELECT 1 AS customer_id, KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256') AS keyset UNION ALL
  SELECT 2, KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256') UNION ALL
  SELECT 3, KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256')
), PlaintextCustomerData AS (
  SELECT 1 AS customer_id, 'elephant' AS favorite_animal UNION ALL
  SELECT 2, 'walrus' UNION ALL
  SELECT 3, 'leopard'
)

  AEAD.ENCRYPT(
    (SELECT keyset
     FROM CustomerKeysets AS ck
     WHERE ck.customer_id = pcd.customer_id),
    pcd.favorite_animal,
    CAST(pcd.customer_id AS STRING)
  ) AS encrypted_animal
FROM PlaintextCustomerData AS pcd;
```

## `     DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_BYTES    `

``` text
DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_BYTES(keyset, ciphertext, additional_data)
```

**Description**

Uses the matching key from `  keyset  ` to decrypt `  ciphertext  ` and verifies the integrity of the data using `  additional_data  ` . Returns an error if decryption fails.

`  keyset  ` is a serialized `  BYTES  ` value or a `  STRUCT  ` value returned by one of the `  KEYS  ` functions. `  keyset  ` must contain the key that was used to encrypt `  ciphertext  ` , the key must be in an `  'ENABLED'  ` state, and the key must be of type `  DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256  ` , or else the function returns an error. `  DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_BYTES  ` identifies the matching key in `  keyset  ` by finding the key with the key ID that matches the one encrypted in `  ciphertext  ` .

`  ciphertext  ` is a `  BYTES  ` value that's the result of a call to `  DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT  ` where the input `  plaintext  ` was of type `  BYTES  ` .

The ciphertext must follow Tink's [wire format](https://developers.google.com/tink/wire-format#deterministic_aead) . The first byte of `  ciphertext  ` should contain a Tink key version followed by a 4 byte key hint. If `  ciphertext  ` includes an initialization vector (IV), it should be the next bytes of `  ciphertext  ` . If `  ciphertext  ` includes an authentication tag, it should be the last bytes of `  ciphertext  ` . If the IV and authentic tag are one (SIV), it should be the first bytes of `  ciphertext  ` . The IV and authentication tag commonly require 16 bytes, but may vary in size.

`  additional_data  ` is a `  STRING  ` or `  BYTES  ` value that binds the ciphertext to its context. This forces the ciphertext to be decrypted in the same context in which it was encrypted. This function casts any `  STRING  ` value to `  BYTES  ` . This must be the same as the `  additional_data  ` provided to `  DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT  ` to encrypt `  ciphertext  ` , ignoring its type, or else the function returns an error.

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

Finally, it uses `  DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_BYTES  ` to decrypt the encrypted values and display them as plaintext.

The following statement creates a table `  CustomerKeysets  ` containing a column of unique IDs, a column of `  DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256  ` keysets, and a column of favorite animals.

``` text
CREATE TABLE deterministic.CustomerKeysets AS

SELECT
  3 AS customer_id,
  KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256') AS keyset,

```

The following statement creates a table `  EncryptedCustomerData  ` containing a column of unique IDs and a column of ciphertext. The statement encrypts the plaintext `  favorite_animal  ` using the keyset value from `  CustomerKeysets  ` corresponding to each unique ID.

``` text
CREATE TABLE deterministic.EncryptedCustomerData AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT(ck.keyset, favorite_animal, CAST(CAST(customer_id AS STRING) AS BYTES))
   AS encrypted_animal
FROM
  deterministic.CustomerKeysets AS ck;
```

The following query uses the keysets in the `  CustomerKeysets  ` table to decrypt data in the `  EncryptedCustomerData  ` table.

``` text
SELECT
  ecd.customer_id,
  DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_BYTES(
    (SELECT ck.keyset

    ecd.encrypted_animal,
    CAST(CAST(ecd.customer_id AS STRING) AS BYTES)
  ) AS favorite_animal
FROM deterministic.EncryptedCustomerData AS ecd;
```

## `     DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_STRING    `

``` text
DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_STRING(keyset, ciphertext, additional_data)
```

**Description**

Like [`  DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_BYTES  `](#deterministic_decrypt_bytes) , but where `  plaintext  ` is of type `  STRING  ` .

**Return Data Type**

`  STRING  `

## `     DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT    `

``` text
DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT(keyset, plaintext, additional_data)
```

**Description**

Encrypts `  plaintext  ` using the primary cryptographic key in `  keyset  ` using [deterministic AEAD](https://developers.google.com/tink/deterministic-aead) . The algorithm of the primary key must be `  DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256  ` . Binds the ciphertext to the context defined by `  additional_data  ` . Returns `  NULL  ` if any input is `  NULL  ` .

`  keyset  ` is a serialized `  BYTES  ` value or a `  STRUCT  ` value returned by one of the `  KEYS  ` functions.

`  plaintext  ` is the `  STRING  ` or `  BYTES  ` value to be encrypted.

`  additional_data  ` is a `  STRING  ` or `  BYTES  ` value that binds the ciphertext to its context. This forces the ciphertext to be decrypted in the same context in which it was encrypted. `  plaintext  ` and `  additional_data  ` must be of the same type. `  DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT(keyset, string1, string2)  ` is equivalent to `  DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT(keyset, CAST(string1 AS BYTES), CAST(string2 AS BYTES))  ` .

The output is ciphertext `  BYTES  ` . The ciphertext contains a [Tink-specific](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/docs/KEY-MANAGEMENT.md) prefix indicating the key used to perform the encryption. Given an identical `  keyset  ` and `  plaintext  ` , this function returns the same ciphertext each time it's invoked (including across queries).

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

The following query uses the keysets for each `  customer_id  ` in the `  CustomerKeysets  ` table to encrypt the value of the plaintext `  favorite_animal  ` in the `  PlaintextCustomerData  ` table corresponding to that `  customer_id  ` . The output contains a column of `  customer_id  ` values and a column of corresponding ciphertext output as `  BYTES  ` .

``` text
WITH CustomerKeysets AS (
  SELECT 1 AS customer_id,
  KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256') AS keyset UNION ALL
  SELECT 2, KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256') UNION ALL
  SELECT 3, KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256')
), PlaintextCustomerData AS (

     FROM CustomerKeysets AS ck
     WHERE ck.customer_id = pcd.customer_id),
    pcd.favorite_animal,
    CAST(pcd.customer_id AS STRING)
  ) AS encrypted_animal
FROM PlaintextCustomerData AS pcd;
```

## `     KEYS.ADD_KEY_FROM_RAW_BYTES    `

``` text
KEYS.ADD_KEY_FROM_RAW_BYTES(keyset, key_type, raw_key_bytes)
```

**Description**

Returns a serialized keyset as `  BYTES  ` with the addition of a key to `  keyset  ` based on `  key_type  ` and `  raw_key_bytes  ` .

The primary cryptographic key remains the same as in `  keyset  ` . The expected length of `  raw_key_bytes  ` depends on the value of `  key_type  ` . The following are supported `  key_types  ` :

  - `  'AES_CBC_PKCS'  ` : Creates a key for AES decryption using cipher block chaining and PKCS padding. `  raw_key_bytes  ` is expected to be a raw key `  BYTES  ` value of length 16, 24, or 32; these lengths have sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, respectively. GoogleSQL AEAD functions don't support keys of these types for encryption; instead, prefer `  'AEAD_AES_GCM_256'  ` or `  'AES_GCM'  ` keys.
  - `  'AES_GCM'  ` : Creates a key for AES decryption or encryption using [Galois/Counter Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) . `  raw_key_bytes  ` must be a raw key `  BYTES  ` value of length 16 or 32; these lengths have sizes of 128 and 256 bits, respectively. When keys of this type are inputs to `  AEAD.ENCRYPT  ` , the output ciphertext doesn't have a Tink-specific prefix indicating which key was used as input.

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

The following query creates a table of customer IDs along with raw key bytes, called `  CustomerRawKeys  ` , and a table of unique IDs, called `  CustomerIds  ` . It creates a new `  'AEAD_AES_GCM_256'  ` keyset for each `  customer_id  ` ; then it adds a new key to each keyset, using the `  raw_key_bytes  ` value corresponding to that `  customer_id  ` . The output is a table where each row contains a `  customer_id  ` and a keyset in `  BYTES  ` , which contains the raw key added using KEYS.ADD\_KEY\_FROM\_RAW\_BYTES.

``` text
WITH CustomerRawKeys AS (
  SELECT 1 AS customer_id, b'0123456789012345' AS raw_key_bytes UNION ALL
  SELECT 2, b'9876543210543210' UNION ALL
  SELECT 3, b'0123012301230123'
), CustomerIds AS (
  SELECT 1 AS customer_id UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 UNION ALL
  SELECT 3
)
SELECT
  ci.customer_id,
  KEYS.ADD_KEY_FROM_RAW_BYTES(
    KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256'),
    'AES_CBC_PKCS',
    (SELECT raw_key_bytes FROM CustomerRawKeys AS crk
     WHERE crk.customer_id = ci.customer_id)
  ) AS keyset
FROM CustomerIds AS ci;
```

The output keysets each contain two things: the primary cryptographic key created using `  KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256')  ` , and the raw key added using `  KEYS.ADD_KEY_FROM_RAW_BYTES  ` . If a keyset in the output is used with `  AEAD.ENCRYPT  ` , GoogleSQL uses the primary cryptographic key created using `  KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256')  ` to encrypt the input plaintext. If the keyset is used with `  AEAD.DECRYPT_STRING  ` or `  AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES  ` , GoogleSQL returns the resulting plaintext if either key succeeds in decrypting the ciphertext.

## `     KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN    `

``` text
KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(kms_resource_name, first_level_keyset)
```

**Description**

Can be used in place of the `  keyset  ` argument to the AEAD and deterministic encryption functions to pass a [Tink](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/docs/KEY-MANAGEMENT.md) keyset that's encrypted with a [Cloud KMS key](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#cloud_kms_protection) . This function lets you use other AEAD functions without including plaintext keys in a query.

This function takes the following arguments:

  - `  kms_resource_name  ` : A `  STRING  ` literal that contains the resource path to the Cloud KMS key that's used to decrypt `  first_level_keyset  ` . This key must reside in the same Cloud region where this function is executed. A Cloud KMS key looks like this:
    
    ``` text
    gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key
    ```

  - `  first_level_keyset  ` : A `  BYTES  ` literal that represents a [keyset](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#keysets) or [wrapped keyset](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#wrapped_keysets) .

**Return Data Type**

`  STRUCT  `

**Example**

This example creates a table of example data, then shows how to encrypt that data using a wrapped (encrypted) keyset. Finally it shows how to query the encrypted version of the data.

The following statement creates a table `  RawCustomerData  ` containing a column of customer ids and a column of favorite animals.

``` text
CREATE TABLE aead.RawCustomerData AS
SELECT
  1 AS customer_id,
  b'jaguar' AS favorite_animal
UNION ALL
SELECT
  2 AS customer_id,
  b'zebra' AS favorite_animal
UNION ALL
SELECT
  3 AS customer_id,
  b'zebra' AS favorite_animal;
```

The following statement creates a table `  EncryptedCustomerData  ` containing a column of unique IDs and a column of ciphertext. The statement encrypts the plaintext `  favorite_animal  ` using the first\_level\_keyset provided.

``` text
DECLARE kms_resource_name STRING;
DECLARE first_level_keyset BYTES;
SET kms_resource_name = 'gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key';
SET first_level_keyset = b'\012\044\000\107\275\360\176\264\206\332\235\215\304...';

CREATE TABLE aead.EncryptedCustomerData AS
SELECT
  customer_id,
  AEAD.ENCRYPT(
    KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(kms_resource_name, first_level_keyset),
    favorite_animal,
    CAST(CAST(customer_id AS STRING) AS BYTES)
  ) AS encrypted_animal
FROM
  aead.RawCustomerData;
```

The following query uses the first\_level\_keyset to decrypt data in the `  EncryptedCustomerData  ` table.

``` text
DECLARE kms_resource_name STRING;
DECLARE first_level_keyset BYTES;
SET kms_resource_name = 'gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key';
SET first_level_keyset = b'\012\044\000\107\275\360\176\264\206\332\235\215\304...';

  AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES(
    KEYS.KEYSET_CHAIN(kms_resource_name, first_level_keyset),
    encrypted_animal,
    CAST(CAST(customer_id AS STRING) AS BYTES)
  ) AS favorite_animal
FROM
  aead.EncryptedCustomerData;
```

The previous two steps also work with the `  DETERMINISTIC_ENCRYPT  ` and `  DETERMINISTIC_DECRYPT_BYTES  ` functions. The wrapped keyset must be created using the `  DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256  ` type.

The following statement creates a table `  EncryptedCustomerData  ` containing a column of unique IDs and a column of ciphertext. The statement encrypts the plaintext `  favorite_animal  ` using the first\_level\_keyset provided. You can see that the ciphertext for `  favorite_animal  ` is the same for customers 2 and 3 since their plaintext `  favorite_animal  ` is the same.

``` text
DECLARE kms_resource_name STRING;
DECLARE first_level_keyset BYTES;
SET kms_resource_name = 'gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key';
SET first_level_keyset = b'\012\044\000\107\275\360\176\264\206\332\235\215\304...';

CREATE TABLE daead.EncryptedCustomerData AS

    favorite_animal,
    CAST(CAST(customer_id AS STRING) AS BYTES)
  ) AS encrypted_animal
FROM
  daead.RawCustomerData;
```

The following query uses the first\_level\_keyset to decrypt data in the `  EncryptedCustomerData  ` table.

``` text
DECLARE kms_resource_name STRING;
DECLARE first_level_keyset BYTES;
SET kms_resource_name = 'gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key';

## `     KEYS.KEYSET_FROM_JSON    `

``` text
KEYS.KEYSET_FROM_JSON(json_keyset)
```

**Description**

Returns the input `  json_keyset  ` `  STRING  ` as serialized `  BYTES  ` , which is a valid input for other `  KEYS  ` and `  AEAD  ` functions. The JSON `  STRING  ` must be compatible with the definition of the [google.crypto.tink.Keyset](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/proto/tink.proto) protocol buffer message: the JSON keyset should be a JSON object containing objects and name-value pairs corresponding to those in the "keyset" message in the google.crypto.tink.Keyset definition. You can convert the output serialized `  BYTES  ` representation back to a JSON `  STRING  ` using `  KEYS.KEYSET_TO_JSON  ` .

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

`  KEYS.KEYSET_FROM_JSON  ` takes JSON-formatted `  STRING  ` values like the following:

``` text
{
  "key":[
      {
        "keyData":{
          "keyMaterialType":"SYMMETRIC",
          "typeUrl":"type.googleapis.com/google.crypto.tink.AesGcmKey",
          "value":"GiD80Z8kL6AP3iSNHhqseZGAIvq7TVQzClT7FQy8YwK3OQ=="
        },
        "keyId":3101427138,
        "outputPrefixType":"TINK",
        "status":"ENABLED"
      }
    ],
  "primaryKeyId":3101427138
}
```

The following query creates a new keyset from a JSON-formatted `  STRING  ` `  json_keyset  ` :

``` text
SELECT KEYS.KEYSET_FROM_JSON(json_keyset);
```

This returns the `  json_keyset  ` serialized as `  BYTES  ` , like the following:

``` text
\x08\x9d\x8e\x85\x82\x09\x12d\x0aX\x0a0
type.googleapis.com/google.crypto.tink.AesGcmKey\x12\"\x1a qX\xe4IG\x87\x1f\xde

\x10\x01\x18\x9d\x8e\x85\x82\x09 \x01
```

## `     KEYS.KEYSET_LENGTH    `

``` text
KEYS.KEYSET_LENGTH(keyset)
```

**Description**

Returns the number of keys in the provided keyset.

**Return Data Type**

`  INT64  `

**Example**

This example references a JSON-formatted STRING called `  json_keyset  ` that contains two keys:

``` text
{
   "primaryKeyId":1354994251,
   "key":[
      {
         "keyData":{
            "keyMaterialType":"SYMMETRIC",
            "typeUrl":"type.googleapis.com/google.crypto.tink.AesGcmKey",
            "value":"GiD9sxQRgFj4aYN78vaIlxInjZkG/uvyWSY9a8GN+ELV2Q=="
         },
         "keyId":1354994251,
         "outputPrefixType":"TINK",
         "status":"ENABLED"
      }
   ],
   "key":[
      {
         "keyData":{
            "keyMaterialType":"SYMMETRIC",
            "typeUrl":"type.googleapis.com/google.crypto.tink.AesGcmKey",
            "value":"PRn76sxQRgFj4aYN00vaIlxInjZkG/uvyWSY9a2bLRm"
         },
         "keyId":852264701,
         "outputPrefixType":"TINK",
         "status":"DISABLED"
      }
   ]
}
```

The following query converts `  json_keyset  ` to a keyset and then returns the number of keys in the keyset:

``` text
SELECT KEYS.KEYSET_LENGTH(KEYS.KEYSET_FROM_JSON(json_keyset)) as key_count;

/*-----------+
 | key_count |
 +-----------+
 | 2         |
 +-----------*/
```

## `     KEYS.KEYSET_TO_JSON    `

``` text
KEYS.KEYSET_TO_JSON(keyset)
```

**Description**

Returns a JSON `  STRING  ` representation of the input `  keyset  ` . The returned JSON `  STRING  ` is compatible with the definition of the [google.crypto.tink.Keyset](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/proto/tink.proto) protocol buffer message. You can convert the JSON `  STRING  ` representation back to `  BYTES  ` using `  KEYS.KEYSET_FROM_JSON  ` .

**Return Data Type**

`  STRING  `

**Example**

The following query returns a new `  'AEAD_AES_GCM_256'  ` keyset as a JSON-formatted `  STRING  ` .

``` text
SELECT KEYS.KEYSET_TO_JSON(KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256'));
```

The result is a `  STRING  ` like the following.

``` text
{
  "key":[
      {
        "keyData":{
          "keyMaterialType":"SYMMETRIC",
          "typeUrl":"type.googleapis.com/google.crypto.tink.AesGcmKey",
          "value":"GiD80Z8kL6AP3iSNHhqseZGAIvq7TVQzClT7FQy8YwK3OQ=="
        },
        "keyId":3101427138,
        "outputPrefixType":"TINK",
        "status":"ENABLED"
      }
    ],
  "primaryKeyId":3101427138
}
```

## `     KEYS.NEW_KEYSET    `

``` text
KEYS.NEW_KEYSET(key_type)
```

**Description**

Returns a serialized keyset containing a new key based on `  key_type  ` . The returned keyset is a serialized `  BYTES  ` representation of [google.crypto.tink.Keyset](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/proto/tink.proto) that contains a primary cryptographic key and no additional keys. You can use the keyset with the `  AEAD.ENCRYPT  ` , `  AEAD.DECRYPT_BYTES  ` , and `  AEAD.DECRYPT_STRING  ` functions for encryption and decryption, as well as with the `  KEYS  ` group of key- and keyset-related functions.

`  key_type  ` is a `  STRING  ` literal representation of the type of key to create. `  key_type  ` can't be `  NULL  ` . `  key_type  ` can be:

  - `  AEAD_AES_GCM_256  ` : Creates a 256-bit key with the pseudo-random number generator provided by [boringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/) . The key uses AES-GCM for encryption and decryption operations.
  - `  DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256  ` : Creates a 512-bit `  AES-SIV-CMAC  ` key, which contains a 256-bit `  AES-CTR  ` key and 256-bit `  AES-CMAC  ` key. The `  AES-SIV-CMAC  ` key is created with the pseudo-random number generator provided by [boringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/) . The key uses AES-SIV for encryption and decryption operations.

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

The following query creates a keyset for each row in `  CustomerIds  ` , which can subsequently be used to encrypt data. Each keyset contains a single encryption key with randomly-generated key data. Each row in the output contains a `  customer_id  ` and an `  'AEAD_AES_GCM_256'  ` key in `  BYTES  ` .

``` text
SELECT customer_id, KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256') AS keyset
FROM (
  SELECT 1 AS customer_id UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 UNION ALL
  SELECT 3
) AS CustomerIds;
```

## `     KEYS.NEW_WRAPPED_KEYSET    `

``` text
KEYS.NEW_WRAPPED_KEYSET(kms_resource_name, key_type)
```

**Description**

Creates a new keyset and encrypts it with a [Cloud KMS key](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#cloud_kms_protection) . Returns the [wrapped keyset](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#wrapped_keysets) as a `  BYTES  ` representation of [google.crypto.tink.Keyset](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/proto/tink.proto) that contains a primary cryptographic key and no additional keys.

This function takes the following arguments:

  - `  kms_resource_name  ` : A `  STRING  ` literal representation of the Cloud KMS key. `  kms_resource_name  ` can't be `  NULL  ` . The Cloud KMS key must reside in the same Cloud region where this function is executed. A Cloud KMS key looks like this:
    
    ``` text
    gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key
    ```

  - `  key_type  ` : A `  STRING  ` literal representation of the keyset type. `  key_type  ` can't be `  NULL  ` but can be one of the following values:
    
      - `  AEAD_AES_GCM_256  ` : Creates a 256-bit key with the pseudo-random number generator provided by [boringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/) . The key uses AES-GCM for encryption and decryption operations.
    
      - `  DETERMINISTIC_AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256  ` : Creates a 512-bit `  AES-SIV-CMAC  ` key, which contains a 256-bit `  AES-CTR  ` key and 256-bit `  AES-CMAC  ` key. The `  AES-SIV-CMAC  ` key is created with the pseudo-random number generator provided by [boringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/) . The key uses AES-SIV for encryption and decryption operations.

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

Put the following variables above each example query that you run:

``` text
DECLARE kms_resource_name STRING;
SET kms_resource_name = 'gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key';
```

The following query creates a wrapped keyset, which contains the ciphertext produced by encrypting a [Tink](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/proto/tink.proto) keyset with the specified Cloud KMS key. If you run the query multiple times, it generates multiple wrapped keysets, and each wrapped keyset is unique to each query that's run.

``` text
SELECT KEYS.NEW_WRAPPED_KEYSET(kms_resource_name, 'AEAD_AES_GCM_256');
```

Multiple calls to this function with the same arguments in one query returns the same value. For example, the following query only creates one wrapped keyset and returns it for each row in a table called `  my_table  ` .

``` text
SELECT
  *,
  KEYS.NEW_WRAPPED_KEYSET(kms_resource_name, 'AEAD_AES_GCM_256')
FROM my_table
```

## `     KEYS.REWRAP_KEYSET    `

``` text
KEYS.REWRAP_KEYSET(source_kms_resource_name, target_kms_resource_name, wrapped_keyset)
```

**Description**

Re-encrypts a [wrapped keyset](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#wrapped_keysets) with a new [Cloud KMS key](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#cloud_kms_protection) . Returns the wrapped keyset as a `  BYTES  ` representation of [google.crypto.tink.Keyset](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/proto/tink.proto) that contains a primary cryptographic key and no additional keys.

When this function is used, a wrapped keyset is decrypted by `  source_kms_resource_name  ` and then re-encrypted by `  target_kms_resource_name  ` . During this process, the decrypted keyset is never visible to customers.

This function takes the following arguments:

  - `  source_kms_resource_name  ` : A `  STRING  ` literal representation of the Cloud KMS key you want to replace. This key must reside in the same Cloud region where this function is executed. A Cloud KMS key looks like this:
    
    ``` text
    gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key
    ```

  - `  target_kms_resource_name  ` : A `  STRING  ` literal representation of the new Cloud KMS key that you want to use.

  - `  wrapped_keyset  ` : A `  BYTES  ` literal representation of the keyset that you want to re-encrypt.

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

Put the following variables above each example query that you run:

``` text
DECLARE source_kms_resource_name STRING;
DECLARE target_kms_resource_name STRING;
DECLARE wrapped_keyset BYTES;
SET source_kms_resource_name = 'gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key';
SET target_kms_resource_name = 'gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/another-location/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-other-crypto-key';
SET wrapped_keyset = b'\012\044\000\107\275\360\176\264\206\332\235\215\304...';
```

The following query rewraps a wrapped keyset. If you run the query multiple times, it generates multiple wrapped keysets, and each wrapped keyset is unique to each query that's run.

``` text
SELECT KEYS.REWRAP_KEYSET(source_kms_resource_name, target_kms_resource_name, wrapped_keyset);
```

Multiple calls to this function with the same arguments in one query returns the same value. For example, the following query only creates one wrapped keyset and returns it for each row in a table called `  my_table  ` .

``` text
SELECT
  *,
  KEYS.REWRAP_KEYSET(source_kms_resource_name, target_kms_resource_name, wrapped_keyset)
FROM my_table
```

## `     KEYS.ROTATE_KEYSET    `

``` text
KEYS.ROTATE_KEYSET(keyset, key_type)
```

**Description**

Adds a new key to `  keyset  ` based on `  key_type  ` . This new key becomes the primary cryptographic key of the new keyset. Returns the new keyset serialized as `  BYTES  ` .

The old primary cryptographic key from the input `  keyset  ` remains an additional key in the returned keyset.

The new `  key_type  ` must match the key type of existing keys in the `  keyset  ` .

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

The following statement creates a table containing a column of unique `  customer_id  ` values and `  'AEAD_AES_GCM_256'  ` keysets. Then, it creates a new primary cryptographic key within each keyset in the source table using `  KEYS.ROTATE_KEYSET  ` . Each row in the output contains a `  customer_id  ` and an `  'AEAD_AES_GCM_256'  ` keyset in `  BYTES  ` .

``` text
WITH ExistingKeysets AS (
SELECT 1 AS customer_id, KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256') AS keyset
    UNION ALL
  SELECT 2, KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256') UNION ALL
  SELECT 3, KEYS.NEW_KEYSET('AEAD_AES_GCM_256')
)
SELECT customer_id, KEYS.ROTATE_KEYSET(keyset, 'AEAD_AES_GCM_256') AS keyset
FROM ExistingKeysets;
```

## `     KEYS.ROTATE_WRAPPED_KEYSET    `

``` text
KEYS.ROTATE_WRAPPED_KEYSET(kms_resource_name, wrapped_keyset, key_type)
```

**Description**

Takes an existing [wrapped keyset](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#wrapped_keysets) and returns a rotated and rewrapped keyset. The returned wrapped keyset is a `  BYTES  ` representation of [google.crypto.tink.Keyset](https://github.com/google/tink/blob/master/proto/tink.proto) .

When this function is used, the wrapped keyset is decrypted, the new key is added, and then the keyset is re-encrypted. The primary cryptographic key from the input `  wrapped_keyset  ` remains as an additional key in the returned keyset. During this rotation process, the decrypted keyset is never visible to customers.

This function takes the following arguments:

  - `  kms_resource_name  ` : A `  STRING  ` literal representation of the [Cloud KMS key](/bigquery/docs/aead-encryption-concepts#cloud_kms_protection) that was used to wrap the wrapped keyset. The Cloud KMS key must reside in the same Cloud region where this function is executed. A Cloud KMS key looks like this:
    
    ``` text
    gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key
    ```

  - `  wrapped_keyset  ` : A `  BYTES  ` literal representation of the existing keyset that you want to work with.

  - `  key_type  ` : A `  STRING  ` literal representation of the keyset type. This must match the key type of existing keys in `  wrapped_keyset  ` .

**Return Data Type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

Put the following variables above each example query that you run:

``` text
DECLARE kms_resource_name STRING;
DECLARE wrapped_keyset BYTES;
SET kms_resource_name = 'gcp-kms://projects/my-project/locations/us/keyRings/my-key-ring/cryptoKeys/my-crypto-key';
SET wrapped_keyset = b'\012\044\000\107\275\360\176\264\206\332\235\215\304...';
```

The following query rotates a wrapped keyset. If you run the query multiple times, it generates multiple wrapped keysets, and each wrapped keyset is unique to each query that's run.

``` text
SELECT KEYS.ROTATE_WRAPPED_KEYSET(kms_resource_name, wrapped_keyset, 'AEAD_AES_GCM_256');
```

Multiple calls to this function with the same arguments in one query returns the same value. For example, the following query only creates one wrapped keyset and returns it for each row in a table called `  my_table  ` .

``` text
SELECT
  *,
  KEYS.ROTATE_WRAPPED_KEYSET(kms_resource_name, wrapped_keyset, 'AEAD_AES_GCM_256')
FROM my_table
```
