# The ML.FEATURE\_INFO function

This document describes the `  ML.FEATURE_INFO  ` function, which lets you see information about the input features that are used to train a model.

For more information about which models support this function, see [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey) .

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.FEATURE_INFO(MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL_NAME`)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.FEATURE_INFO  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` : The BigQuery dataset that contains the model.
  - `  MODEL_NAME  ` : The name of the model.

## Output

`  ML.FEATURE_INFO  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  input  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the name of the column in the input training data.
  - `  min  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the minimum value in the `  input  ` column. `  min  ` is `  NULL  ` for non-numeric inputs.
  - `  max  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the maximum value in the `  input  ` column. `  max  ` is `  NULL  ` for non-numeric inputs.
  - `  mean  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the average value for the `  input  ` column. `  mean  ` is `  NULL  ` for non-numeric inputs.
  - `  median  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the median value for the `  input  ` column. `  median  ` is `  NULL  ` for non-numeric inputs.
  - `  stddev  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the standard deviation value for the `  input  ` column. `  stddev  ` is `  NULL  ` for non-numeric inputs.
  - `  category_count  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the number of categories in the `  input  ` column. `  category_count  ` is `  NULL  ` for non-categorical columns.
  - `  null_count  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the number of `  NULL  ` values in the `  input  ` column.
  - `  dimension  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the dimension of the `  input  ` column if the `  input  ` column has a `  ARRAY<STRUCT>  ` type. `  dimension  ` is `  NULL  ` for non- `  ARRAY<STRUCT>  ` columns.

For [matrix factorization](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-matrix-factorization) models, only `  category_count  ` is calculated for the `  user  ` and `  item  ` columns.

If you used the [`  TRANSFORM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform) in the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement that created the model, `  ML.FEATURE_INFO  ` outputs the information of the pre-transform columns from the `  query_statement  ` argument.

## Permissions

You must have the `  bigquery.models.create  ` and `  bigquery.models.getData  ` [Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bq-permissions) in order to run `  ML.FEATURE_INFO  ` .

## Limitations

`  ML.FEATURE_INFO  ` doesn't support [imported TensorFlow models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-tensorflow) .

## Example

The following example retrieves feature information from the model `  mydataset.mymodel  ` in your default project:

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.FEATURE_INFO(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`)
```
