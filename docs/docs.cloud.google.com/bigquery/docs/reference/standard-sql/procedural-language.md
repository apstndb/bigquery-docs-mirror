The GoogleSQL procedural language lets you execute multiple statements in one query as a multi-statement query. You can use a multi-statement query to:

  - Run multiple statements in a sequence, with shared state.
  - Automate management tasks such as creating or dropping tables.
  - Implement complex logic using programming constructs such as `  IF  ` and `  WHILE  ` .

This reference contains the statements that are part of the GoogleSQL procedural language. To learn more about how you can use this procedural language to write multi-statement queries, see [Work with multi-statement queries](/bigquery/docs/multi-statement-queries) . To learn how you can convert multi-statement queries into stored procedures, see [Work with stored procedures](/bigquery/docs/procedures) .

## `     DECLARE    `

``` text
DECLARE variable_name[, ...] [variable_type] [DEFAULT expression];
```

`  variable_name  ` must be a valid identifier, and `  variable_type  ` is any GoogleSQL [type](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types) .

**Description**

Declares a variable of the specified type. If the `  DEFAULT  ` clause is specified, the variable is initialized with the value of the expression; if no `  DEFAULT  ` clause is present, the variable is initialized with the value `  NULL  ` .

If `  [variable_type]  ` is omitted then a `  DEFAULT  ` clause must be specified. The variable’s type will be inferred by the type of the expression in the `  DEFAULT  ` clause.

Variable declarations must appear before other procedural statements, or at the start of a `  BEGIN  ` block. Variable names are case-insensitive.

Multiple variable names can appear in a single `  DECLARE  ` statement, but only one `  variable_type  ` and `  expression  ` .

It's an error to declare a variable with the same name as a variable declared earlier in the current block or in a containing block.

If the `  DEFAULT  ` clause is present, the value of the expression must be coercible to the specified type. The expression may reference other variables declared previously within the same block or a containing block.

GoogleSQL also supports [system variables](/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables) . You don't need to declare system variables, but you can set any of them that aren't marked read-only. You can reference system variables in queries.

**Examples**

The following example initializes the variable `  x  ` as an `  INT64  ` with the value `  NULL  ` .

``` text
DECLARE x INT64;
```

The following example initializes the variable `  d  ` as a `  DATE  ` object with the value of the current date.

``` text
DECLARE d DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE();
```

The following example initializes the variables `  x  ` , `  y  ` , and `  z  ` as `  INT64  ` with the value 0.

``` text
DECLARE x, y, z INT64 DEFAULT 0;
```

The following example declares a variable named `  item  ` corresponding to an arbitrary item in the `  schema1.products  ` table. The type of `  item  ` is inferred from the table schema.

``` text
DECLARE item DEFAULT (SELECT item FROM schema1.products LIMIT 1);
```

## `     SET    `

**Syntax**

``` text
SET variable_name = expression;
```

``` text
SET (variable_name[, ...]) = (expression[, ...]);
```

**Description**

Sets a variable to have the value of the provided expression, or sets multiple variables at the same time based on the result of multiple expressions.

The `  SET  ` statement may appear anywhere within a multi-statement query.

**Examples**

The following example sets the variable `  x  ` to have the value 5.

``` text
SET x = 5;
```

The following example sets the variable `  a  ` to have the value 4, `  b  ` to have the value 'foo', and the variable `  c  ` to have the value `  false  ` .

``` text
SET (a, b, c) = (1 + 3, 'foo', false);
```

The following example assigns the result of a query to multiple variables. First, it declares two variables, `  target_word  ` and `  corpus_count  ` ; next, it assigns the results of a [`  SELECT AS STRUCT  ` query](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#select_as_struct) to the two variables. The result of the query is a single row containing a `  STRUCT  ` with two fields; the first element is assigned to the first variable, and the second element is assigned to the second variable.

``` text
DECLARE target_word STRING DEFAULT 'methinks';
DECLARE corpus_count, word_count INT64;

SET (corpus_count, word_count) = (
  SELECT AS STRUCT COUNT(DISTINCT corpus), SUM(word_count)
  FROM bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare
  WHERE LOWER(word) = target_word
);

SELECT
  FORMAT('Found %d occurrences of "%s" across %d Shakespeare works',
         word_count, target_word, corpus_count) AS result;
```

This statement list outputs the following string:

``` text
Found 151 occurrences of "methinks" across 38 Shakespeare works
```

## `     EXECUTE IMMEDIATE    `

**Syntax**

``` text
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_expression [ INTO variable[, ...] ] [ USING identifier[, ...] ];

sql_expression:
  { "query_statement" | expression("query_statement") }

identifier:
  { variable | value } [ AS alias ]
```

**Description**

Executes a dynamic SQL statement on the fly.

  - `  sql_expression  ` : An expression that can represent one of the following:
    
      - A [query statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax)
    
      - An expression that you can use on a query statement
    
      - A single [DDL statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language)
    
      - A single [DML statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-manipulation-language)
    
      - A single [DCL statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-control-language)
    
    This expression can't be a control statement like `  IF  ` .

  - `  expression  ` : Can be a [function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-all) , [conditional expression](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conditional_expressions) , or [expression subquery](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries#expression_subquery_concepts) .

  - `  query_statement  ` : Represents a valid standalone SQL statement to execute. If this returns a value, the `  INTO  ` clause must contain values of the same type. You may access both system variables and values present in the `  USING  ` clause; all other local variables and query parameters aren't exposed to the query statement.

  - `  INTO  ` clause: After the SQL expression is executed, you can store the results in one or more [variables](#declare) , using the `  INTO  ` clause.

  - `  USING  ` clause: Before you execute your SQL expression, you can pass in one or more identifiers from the `  USING  ` clause into the SQL expression. These identifiers function similarly to query parameters, exposing values to the query statement. An identifier can be a variable or a value.

You can include these placeholders in the `  query_statement  ` for identifiers referenced in the `  USING  ` clause:

  - `  ?  ` : The value for this placeholder is bound to an identifier in the `  USING  ` clause by index.
    
    ``` text
    DECLARE y INT64;
    -- y = 1 * (3 + 2) = 5
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE "SELECT ? * (? + 2)" INTO y USING 1, 3;
    ```

  - `  @identifier  ` : The value for this placeholder is bound to an identifier in the `  USING  ` clause by name. This syntax is identical to the query parameter syntax.
    
    ``` text
    DECLARE y INT64;
    -- y = 1 * (3 + 2) = 5
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE "SELECT @a * (@b + 2)" INTO y USING 1 as a, 3 as b;
    ```

Here are some additional notes about the behavior of the `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement:

  - `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` is restricted from being executed dynamically as a nested element. This means `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` can't be nested in another `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement.
  - If an `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement returns results, then those results become the result of the entire statement and any appropriate system variables are updated.
  - The same variable can appear in both the `  INTO  ` and `  USING  ` clauses.
  - `  query_statement  ` can contain a single parsed statement that contains other statements (for example, BEGIN...END)
  - If zero rows are returned from `  query_statement  ` , including from zero-row value tables, all variables in the `  INTO  ` clause are set to NULL.
  - If one row is returned from `  query_statement  ` , including from zero-row value tables, values are assigned by position, not variable name.
  - If an `  INTO  ` clause is present, an error is thrown if you attempt to return more than one row from `  query_statement  ` .

**Examples**

In this example, we create a table of books and populate it with data. Note the different ways that you can reference variables, save values to variables, and use expressions.

``` text
-- Create some variables.
DECLARE book_name STRING DEFAULT 'Ulysses';
DECLARE book_year INT64 DEFAULT 1922;
DECLARE first_date INT64;

-- Create a temporary table called Books.
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
  "CREATE TEMP TABLE Books (title STRING, publish_date INT64)";

-- Add a row for Hamlet (less secure).
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
  "INSERT INTO Books (title, publish_date) VALUES('Hamlet', 1599)";

-- Add a row for Ulysses, using the variables declared and the ? placeholder.
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
  "INSERT INTO Books (title, publish_date) VALUES(?, ?)"
  USING book_name, book_year;

-- Add a row for Emma, using the identifier placeholder.
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
  "INSERT INTO Books (title, publish_date) VALUES(@name, @year)"
  USING 1815 as year, "Emma" as name;

-- Add a row for Middlemarch, using an expression.
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
  CONCAT(
    "INSERT INTO Books (title, publish_date)", "VALUES('Middlemarch', 1871)"
  );

-- The table looks similar to the following:
/*------------------+------------------+
 | title            | publish_date     |
 +------------------+------------------+
 | Hamlet           | 1599             |
 | Ulysses          | 1922             |
 | Emma             | 1815             |
 | Middlemarch      | 1871             |
 +------------------+------------------*/

-- Save the publish date of the earliest book, Hamlet, to a variable called
-- first_date.
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE "SELECT MIN(publish_date) FROM Books LIMIT 1" INTO first_date;
```

## `     BEGIN...END    `

**Syntax**

``` text
BEGIN
  sql_statement_list
END;
```

**Description**

`  BEGIN  ` initiates a block of statements where declared variables exist only until the corresponding `  END  ` . `  sql_statement_list  ` is a list of zero or more SQL statements ending with semicolons.

Variable declarations must appear at the start of the block, prior to other types of statements. Variables declared inside a block may only be referenced within that block and in any nested blocks. It's an error to declare a variable with the same name as a variable declared in the same block or an outer block.

There is a maximum nesting level of 50 for blocks and conditional statements such as `  BEGIN  ` / `  END  ` , `  IF  ` / `  ELSE  ` / `  END IF  ` , and `  WHILE  ` / `  END WHILE  ` .

`  BEGIN  ` / `  END  ` is restricted from being executed dynamically as a nested element.

You can use a label with this statement. To learn more, see [Labels](#labels) .

**Examples**

The following example declares a variable `  x  ` with the default value 10; then, it initiates a block, in which a variable `  y  ` is assigned the value of `  x  ` , which is 10, and returns this value; next, the `  END  ` statement ends the block, ending the scope of variable `  y  ` ; finally, it returns the value of `  x  ` .

``` text
DECLARE x INT64 DEFAULT 10;
BEGIN
  DECLARE y INT64;
  SET y = x;
  SELECT y;
END;
SELECT x;
```

## `     BEGIN...EXCEPTION...END    `

**Syntax**

``` text
BEGIN
  sql_statement_list
EXCEPTION WHEN ERROR THEN
  sql_statement_list
END;
```

**Description**

`  BEGIN...EXCEPTION  ` executes a block of statements. If any of the statements encounter an error, the remainder of the block is skipped and the statements in the `  EXCEPTION  ` clause are executed.

Within the `  EXCEPTION  ` clause, you can access details about the error using the following `  EXCEPTION  ` system variables:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%" />
<col style="width: 33%" />

If the frame occurs within a procedure body, then <code dir="ltr" translate="no">         line 1 column 1        </code> corresponds to the <code dir="ltr" translate="no">         BEGIN        </code> keyword at the start of the procedure body.</li>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<sup>1</sup> The type for `  @@error.stack_trace  ` is `  ARRAY<STRUCT<line INT64, column INT64, filename STRING, location STRING>>  ` .

As BigQuery reserves the right to revise error messages at any time, consumers of `  @@error.message  ` shouldn't rely on error messages remaining the same or following any particular pattern. Don't obtain error location information by extracting text out of the error message — use `  @@error.stack_trace  ` and `  @@error.statement_text  ` instead.

To handle exceptions that are thrown (and not handled) by an exception handler itself, you must wrap the block in an outer block with a separate exception handler.

The following shows how to use an outer block with a separate exception handler:

``` text
BEGIN
  BEGIN
    ...
  EXCEPTION WHEN ERROR THEN
    SELECT 1/0;
  END;
EXCEPTION WHEN ERROR THEN
  -- The exception thrown from the inner exception handler lands here.
END;
```

`  BEGIN...EXCEPTION  ` blocks also support `  DECLARE  ` statements, just like any other `  BEGIN  ` block. Variables declared in a `  BEGIN  ` block are valid only in the `  BEGIN  ` section, and may not be used in the block’s exception handler.

You can use a label with this statement. To learn more, see [Labels](#labels) .

**Examples**

In this example, when the division by zero error occurs, instead of stopping the entire multi-statement query, GoogleSQL stops `  schema1.proc1()  ` and `  schema1.proc2()  ` and execute the `  SELECT  ` statement in the exception handler.

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE schema1.proc1() BEGIN
  SELECT 1/0;
END;

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE schema1.proc2() BEGIN
  CALL schema1.proc1();
END;

BEGIN
  CALL schema1.proc2();
EXCEPTION WHEN ERROR THEN
  SELECT
    @@error.message,
    @@error.stack_trace,
    @@error.statement_text,
    @@error.formatted_stack_trace;
END;
```

When the exception handler runs, the variables will have the following values:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

## `     CASE    `

**Syntax**

``` text
CASE
  WHEN boolean_expression THEN sql_statement_list
  [...]
  [ELSE sql_statement_list]
END CASE;
```

**Description**

Executes the `  THEN sql_statement_list  ` where the boolean expression is true, or the optional `  ELSE sql_statement_list  ` if no conditions match.

`  CASE  ` can have a maximum of 50 nesting levels.

`  CASE  ` is restricted from being executed dynamically as a nested element. This means `  CASE  ` can't be nested in an `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement.

**Examples**

In this example, a search if conducted for the `  target_product_ID  ` in the `  products_a  ` table. If the ID isn't found there, a search is conducted for the ID in the `  products_b  ` table. If the ID isn't found there, the statement in the `  ELSE  ` block is executed.

``` text
DECLARE target_product_id INT64 DEFAULT 103;
CASE
  WHEN
    EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM schema.products_a WHERE product_id = target_product_id)
    THEN SELECT 'found product in products_a table';
  WHEN
    EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM schema.products_b WHERE product_id = target_product_id)
    THEN SELECT 'found product in products_b table';
  ELSE
    SELECT 'did not find product';
END CASE;
```

## `     CASE search_expression    `

**Syntax**

``` text
CASE search_expression
  WHEN expression THEN sql_statement_list
  [...]
  [ELSE sql_statement_list]
END CASE;
```

**Description**

Executes the first `  sql_statement_list  ` where the search expression is matches a `  WHEN  ` expression. The `  search_expression  ` is evaluated once and then tested against each `  WHEN  ` expression for equality until a match is found. If no match is found, then the optional `  ELSE  ` `  sql_statement_list  ` is executed.

`  CASE  ` can have a maximum of 50 nesting levels.

`  CASE  ` is restricted from being executed dynamically as a nested element. This means `  CASE  ` can't be nested in an `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement.

**Examples**

The following example uses the product ID as the search expression. If the ID is `  1  ` , `  'Product one'  ` is returned. If the ID is `  2  ` , `  'Product two'  ` is returned. If the ID is anything else, `  Invalid product  ` is returned.

``` text
DECLARE product_id INT64 DEFAULT 1;
CASE product_id
  WHEN 1 THEN
    SELECT CONCAT('Product one');
  WHEN 2 THEN
    SELECT CONCAT('Product two');
  ELSE
    SELECT CONCAT('Invalid product');
END CASE;
```

## `     IF    `

**Syntax**

``` text
IF condition THEN [sql_statement_list]
  [ELSEIF condition THEN sql_statement_list]
  [...]
  [ELSE sql_statement_list]
END IF;
```

**Description**

Executes the first `  sql_statement_list  ` where the condition is true, or the optional `  ELSE  ` `  sql_statement_list  ` if no conditions match.

There is a maximum nesting level of 50 for blocks and conditional statements such as `  BEGIN  ` / `  END  ` , `  IF  ` / `  ELSE  ` / `  END IF  ` , and `  WHILE  ` / `  END WHILE  ` .

`  IF  ` is restricted from being executed dynamically as a nested element. This means `  IF  ` can't be nested in an `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement.

**Examples**

The following example declares a INT64 variable `  target_product_id  ` with a default value of 103; then, it checks whether the table `  schema.products  ` contains a row with the `  product_id  ` column matches the value of `  target_product_id  ` ; if so, it outputs a string stating that the product has been found, along with the value of `  default_product_id  ` ; if not, it outputs a string stating that the product hasn't been found, also with the value of `  default_product_id  ` .

``` text
DECLARE target_product_id INT64 DEFAULT 103;
IF EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM schema.products
           WHERE product_id = target_product_id) THEN
  SELECT CONCAT('found product ', CAST(target_product_id AS STRING));
  ELSEIF EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM schema.more_products
           WHERE product_id = target_product_id) THEN
  SELECT CONCAT('found product from more_products table',
  CAST(target_product_id AS STRING));
ELSE
  SELECT CONCAT('did not find product ', CAST(target_product_id AS STRING));
END IF;
```

## Labels

**Syntax**

``` text
label_name: BEGIN
  block_statement_list
END [label_name];
```

``` text
label_name: LOOP
  loop_statement_list
END LOOP [label_name];
```

``` text
label_name: WHILE condition DO
  loop_statement_list
END WHILE [label_name];
```

``` text
label_name: FOR variable IN query DO
  loop_statement_list
END FOR [label_name];
```

``` text
label_name: REPEAT
  loop_statement_list
  UNTIL boolean_condition
END REPEAT [label_name];
```

``` text
block_statement_list:
  { statement | break_statement_with_label }[, ...]

loop_statement_list:
  { statement | break_continue_statement_with_label }[, ...]

break_statement_with_label:
  { BREAK | LEAVE } label_name;

break_continue_statement_with_label:
  { BREAK | LEAVE | CONTINUE | ITERATE } label_name;
```

**Description**

A BREAK or CONTINUE statement with a label provides an unconditional jump to the end of the block or loop associated with that label. To use a label with a block or loop, the label must appear at the beginning of the block or loop, and optionally at the end.

  - A label name may consist of any GoogleSQL identifier, including the use of backticks to include reserved characters or keywords.

  - Multipart path names can be used, but only as quoted identifiers.
    
    ``` text
    `foo.bar`: BEGIN ... END -- Works
    foo.bar: BEGIN ... END -- Doesn't work
    ```

  - Label names are case-insensitive.

  - Each stored procedure has an independent store of label names. For example, a procedure may redefine a label already used in a calling procedure.

  - A loop or block may not repeat a label name used in an enclosing loop or block.

  - Repeated label names are allowed in non-overlapping parts in procedural statements.

  - A label and variable with the same name is allowed.

  - When the `  BREAK  ` , `  LEAVE  ` , `  CONTINUE  ` , or `  ITERATE  ` statement specifies a label, it exits or continues the loop matching the label name, rather than always picking the innermost loop.

**Examples**

You can only reference a block or loop while inside of it.

``` text
label_1: BEGIN
  SELECT 1;
  BREAK label_1;
  SELECT 2; -- Unreached
END;
```

``` text
label_1: LOOP
  BREAK label_1;
END LOOP label_1;

WHILE x < 1 DO
  CONTINUE label_1; -- Error
END WHILE;
```

Repeated label names are allowed in non-overlapping parts of the multi-statement query. This works:

``` text
label_1: BEGIN
  BREAK label_1;
END;

label_2: BEGIN
  BREAK label_2;
END;

label_1: BEGIN
  BREAK label_1;
END;
```

A loop or block may not repeat a label name used in an enclosing loop or block. This throws an error:

``` text
label_1: BEGIN
   label_1: BEGIN -- Error
     BREAK label_1;
   END;
END;
```

A label and variable can have same name. This works:

``` text
label_1: BEGIN
   DECLARE label_1 INT64;
   BREAK label_1;
END;
```

The `  END  ` keyword terminating a block or loop may specify a label name, but this is optional. These both work:

``` text
label_1: BEGIN
  BREAK label_1;
END label_1;
```

``` text
label_1: BEGIN
  BREAK label_1;
END;
```

You can't have a label at the end of a block or loop if there isn't a label at the beginning of the block or loop. This throws an error:

``` text
BEGIN
  BREAK label_1;
END label_1;
```

In this example, the `  BREAK  ` and `  CONTINUE  ` statements target the outer `  label_1: LOOP  ` , rather than the inner `  WHILE x < 1 DO  ` loop:

``` text
label_1: LOOP
  WHILE x < 1 DO
    IF y < 1 THEN
      CONTINUE label_1;
    ELSE
      BREAK label_1;
  END WHILE;
END LOOP label_1
```

A `  BREAK  ` , `  LEAVE  ` , or `  CONTINUE  ` , or `  ITERATE  ` statement that specifies a label that doesn't exist throws an error:

``` text
WHILE x < 1 DO
  BREAK label_1; -- Error
END WHILE;
```

Exiting a block from within the exception handler section is allowed:

``` text
label_1: BEGIN
  SELECT 1;
  EXCEPTION WHEN ERROR THEN
    BREAK label_1;
    SELECT 2; -- Unreached
END;
```

`  CONTINUE  ` can't be used with a block label. This throws an error:

``` text
label_1: BEGIN
  SELECT 1;
  CONTINUE label_1; -- Error
  SELECT 2;
END;
```

## Loops

### `     LOOP    `

**Syntax**

``` text
LOOP
  sql_statement_list
END LOOP;
```

**Description**

Executes `  sql_statement_list  ` until a `  BREAK  ` or `  LEAVE  ` statement exits the loop. `  sql_statement_list  ` is a list of zero or more SQL statements ending with semicolons.

`  LOOP  ` is restricted from being executed dynamically as a nested element. This means `  LOOP  ` can't be nested in an `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement.

You can use a label with this statement. To learn more, see [Labels](#labels) .

**Examples**

The following example declares a variable `  x  ` with the default value 0; then, it uses the `  LOOP  ` statement to create a loop that executes until the variable `  x  ` is greater than or equal to 10; after the loop exits, the example outputs the value of `  x  ` .

``` text
DECLARE x INT64 DEFAULT 0;
LOOP
  SET x = x + 1;
  IF x >= 10 THEN
    LEAVE;
  END IF;
END LOOP;
SELECT x;
```

This example outputs the following:

``` text
/*----+
 | x  |
 +----+
 | 10 |
 +----*/
```

### `     REPEAT    `

**Syntax**

``` text
REPEAT
  sql_statement_list
  UNTIL boolean_condition
END REPEAT;
```

**Description**

Repeatedly executes a list of zero or more SQL statements until the boolean condition at the end of the list is `  TRUE  ` . The boolean condition must be an expression. You can exit this loop early with the `  BREAK  ` or `  LEAVE  ` statement.

`  REPEAT  ` is restricted from being executed dynamically as a nested element. This means `  REPEAT  ` can't be nested in an `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement.

You can use a label with this statement. To learn more, see [Labels](#labels) .

**Examples**

The following example declares a variable `  x  ` with the default value `  0  ` ; then, it uses the `  REPEAT  ` statement to create a loop that executes until the variable `  x  ` is greater than or equal to `  3  ` .

``` text
DECLARE x INT64 DEFAULT 0;

REPEAT
  SET x = x + 1;
  SELECT x;
  UNTIL x >= 3
END REPEAT;
```

This example outputs the following:

``` text
/*---+
 | x |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 +---*/

/*---+
 | x |
 +---+
 | 2 |
 +---*/

/*---+
 | x |
 +---+
 | 3 |
 +---*/
```

### `     WHILE    `

**Syntax**

``` text
WHILE boolean_expression DO
  sql_statement_list
END WHILE;
```

There is a maximum nesting level of 50 for blocks and conditional statements such as `  BEGIN  ` / `  END  ` , `  IF  ` / `  ELSE  ` / `  END IF  ` , and `  WHILE  ` / `  END WHILE  ` .

**Description**

While `  boolean_expression  ` is true, executes `  sql_statement_list  ` . `  boolean_expression  ` is evaluated for each iteration of the loop.

`  WHILE  ` is restricted from being executed dynamically as a nested element. This means `  WHILE  ` can't be nested in an `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement.

You can use a label with this statement. To learn more, see [Labels](#labels) .

### `     BREAK    `

**Syntax**

``` text
BREAK;
```

**Description**

Exit the current loop.

It's an error to use `  BREAK  ` outside of a loop.

You can use a label with this statement. To learn more, see [Labels](#labels) .

**Examples**

The following example declares two variables, `  heads  ` and `  heads_count  ` ; next, it initiates a loop, which assigns a random boolean value to `  heads  ` , then checks to see whether `  heads  ` is true; if so, it outputs "Heads\!" and increments `  heads_count  ` ; if not, it outputs "Tails\!" and exits the loop; finally, it outputs a string stating how many times the "coin flip" resulted in "heads."

``` text
DECLARE heads BOOL;
DECLARE heads_count INT64 DEFAULT 0;
LOOP
  SET heads = RAND() < 0.5;
  IF heads THEN
    SELECT 'Heads!';
    SET heads_count = heads_count + 1;
  ELSE
    SELECT 'Tails!';
    BREAK;
  END IF;
END LOOP;
SELECT CONCAT(CAST(heads_count AS STRING), ' heads in a row');
```

### `     LEAVE    `

Synonym for [`  BREAK  `](#break) .

### `     CONTINUE    `

**Syntax**

``` text
CONTINUE;
```

**Description**

Skip any following statements in the current loop and return to the start of the loop.

It's an error to use `  CONTINUE  ` outside of a loop.

You can use a label with this statement. To learn more, see [Labels](#labels) .

**Examples**

The following example declares two variables, `  heads  ` and `  heads_count  ` ; next, it initiates a loop, which assigns a random boolean value to `  heads  ` , then checks to see whether `  heads  ` is true; if so, it outputs "Heads\!", increments `  heads_count  ` , and restarts the loop, skipping any remaining statements; if not, it outputs "Tails\!" and exits the loop; finally, it outputs a string stating how many times the "coin flip" resulted in "heads."

``` text
DECLARE heads BOOL;
DECLARE heads_count INT64 DEFAULT 0;
LOOP
  SET heads = RAND() < 0.5;
  IF heads THEN
    SELECT 'Heads!';
    SET heads_count = heads_count + 1;
    CONTINUE;
  END IF;
  SELECT 'Tails!';
  BREAK;
END LOOP;
SELECT CONCAT(CAST(heads_count AS STRING), ' heads in a row');
```

### `     ITERATE    `

Synonym for [`  CONTINUE  `](#continue) .

### `     FOR...IN    `

**Syntax**

``` text
FOR loop_variable_name IN (table_expression)
DO
  sql_expression_list
END FOR;
```

**Description**

Loops over every row in `  table_expression  ` and assigns the row to `  loop_variable_name  ` . Inside each loop, the SQL statements in `  sql_expression_list  ` are executed using the current value of `  loop_variable_name  ` .

The value of `  table_expression  ` is evaluated once at the start of the loop. On each iteration, the value of `  loop_variable_name  ` is a `  STRUCT  ` that contains the top-level columns of the table expression as fields. The order in which values are assigned to `  loop_variable_name  ` isn't defined, unless the table expression has a top-level `  ORDER BY  ` clause or `  UNNEST  ` array operator.

The scope of `  loop_variable_name  ` is the body of the loop. The name of `  loop_variable_name  ` can't conflict with other variables within the same scope.

You can use a label with this statement. To learn more, see [Labels](#labels) .

**Example**

``` text
FOR record IN
  (SELECT word, word_count
   FROM bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare
   LIMIT 5)
DO
  SELECT record.word, record.word_count;
END FOR;
```

## Transactions

### `     BEGIN TRANSACTION    `

**Syntax**

``` text
BEGIN [TRANSACTION];
```

**Description**

Begins a transaction.

The transaction ends when a [`  COMMIT TRANSACTION  `](#commit_transaction) or [`  ROLLBACK TRANSACTION  `](#rollback_transaction) statement is reached. If execution ends before reaching either of these statements, an automatic rollback occurs.

For more information about transactions in BigQuery, see [Multi-statement transactions](/bigquery/docs/transactions) .

**Example**

The following example performs a transaction that selects rows from an existing table into a temporary table, deletes those rows from the original table, and merges the temporary table into another table.

``` text
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Create a temporary table of new arrivals from warehouse #1
CREATE TEMP TABLE tmp AS
SELECT * FROM myschema.NewArrivals WHERE warehouse = 'warehouse #1';

-- Delete the matching records from the original table.
DELETE myschema.NewArrivals WHERE warehouse = 'warehouse #1';

-- Merge the matching records into the Inventory table.
MERGE myschema.Inventory AS I
USING tmp AS T
ON I.product = T.product
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
 INSERT(product, quantity, supply_constrained)
 VALUES(product, quantity, false)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
 UPDATE SET quantity = I.quantity + T.quantity;

DROP TABLE tmp;

COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

### `     COMMIT TRANSACTION    `

**Syntax**

``` text
COMMIT [TRANSACTION];
```

**Description**

Commits an open transaction. If no open transaction is in progress, then the statement fails.

For more information about transactions in BigQuery, see [Multi-statement transactions](/bigquery/docs/transactions) .

**Example**

``` text
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- SQL statements for the transaction go here.

COMMIT TRANSACTION;
```

### `     ROLLBACK TRANSACTION    `

**Syntax**

``` text
ROLLBACK [TRANSACTION];
```

**Description**

Rolls back an open transaction. If there is no open transaction in progress, then the statement fails.

For more information about transactions in BigQuery, see [Multi-statement transactions](/bigquery/docs/transactions) .

**Example**

The following example rolls back a transaction if an error occurs during the transaction. To illustrate the logic, the example triggers a divide-by-zero error after inserting a row into a table. After these statements run, the table is unaffected.

``` text
BEGIN

  BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  INSERT INTO myschema.NewArrivals
    VALUES ('top load washer', 100, 'warehouse #1');
  -- Trigger an error.
  SELECT 1/0;
  COMMIT TRANSACTION;

EXCEPTION WHEN ERROR THEN
  -- Roll back the transaction inside the exception handler.
  SELECT @@error.message;
  ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;
END;
```

## `     RAISE    `

**Syntax**

``` text
RAISE [USING MESSAGE = message];
```

**Description**

Raises an error, optionally using the specified error message when `  USING MESSAGE = message  ` is supplied.

#### When `     USING MESSAGE    ` isn't supplied

The `  RAISE  ` statement must only be used within an `  EXCEPTION  ` clause. The `  RAISE  ` statement will re-raise the exception that was caught, and preserve the original stack trace.

#### When `     USING MESSAGE    ` is supplied

If the `  RAISE  ` statement is contained within the `  BEGIN  ` section of a `  BEGIN...EXCEPTION  ` block:

  - The handler will be invoked.

  - The value of `  @@error.message  ` will exactly match the `  message  ` string supplied (which may be `  NULL  ` if `  message  ` is `  NULL  ` ).

  - The stack trace will be set to the `  RAISE  ` statement.

If the `  RAISE  ` statement isn't contained within the `  BEGIN  ` section of a `  BEGIN...EXCEPTION  ` block, the `  RAISE  ` statement stops execution of the multi-statement query with the error message supplied.

## `     RETURN    `

`  RETURN  ` stops execution of the multi-statements query.

## `     CALL    `

**Syntax**

``` text
CALL procedure_name (procedure_argument[, …])
```

**Description**

Calls a [procedure](/bigquery/docs/procedures) with an argument list. `  procedure_argument  ` may be a variable or an expression.

For `  OUT  ` or `  INOUT  ` arguments, a variable passed as an argument must have the proper GoogleSQL [type](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types) . The same variable may not appear multiple times as an `  OUT  ` or `  INOUT  ` argument in the procedure's argument list.

The maximum depth of procedure calls is 50 frames.

`  CALL  ` is restricted from being executed dynamically as a nested element. This means `  CALL  ` can't be nested in an `  EXECUTE IMMEDIATE  ` statement.

**Examples**

The following example declares a variable `  retCode  ` . Then, it calls the procedure `  updateSomeTables  ` in the schema `  mySchema  ` , passing the arguments `  'someAccountId'  ` and `  retCode  ` . Finally, it returns the value of `  retCode  ` .

``` text
DECLARE retCode INT64;
-- Procedure signature: (IN account_id STRING, OUT retCode INT64)
CALL mySchema.UpdateSomeTables('someAccountId', retCode);
SELECT retCode;
```
