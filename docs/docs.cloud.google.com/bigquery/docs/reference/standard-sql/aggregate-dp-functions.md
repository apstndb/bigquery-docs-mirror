GoogleSQL for BigQuery supports differentially private aggregate functions. For an explanation of how aggregate functions work, see [Aggregate function calls](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-function-calls) .

You can only use differentially private aggregate functions with [differentially private queries](/bigquery/docs/differential-privacy) in a [differential privacy clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#dp_clause) .

**Note:** In this topic, the privacy parameters in the examples aren't recommendations. You should work with your privacy or security officer to determine the optimal privacy parameters for your dataset and organization.

## `     AVG    ` ( `     DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY    ` )

``` text
WITH DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY ...
  AVG(
    expression,
    [ contribution_bounds_per_group => (lower_bound, upper_bound) ]
  )
```

**Description**

Returns the average of non- `  NULL  ` , non- `  NaN  ` values in the expression. This function first computes the average per privacy unit column, and then computes the final result by averaging these averages.

This function must be used with the [`  DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#dp_clause) and can support the following arguments:

  - `  expression  ` : The input expression. This can be any numeric input type, such as `  INT64  ` .
  - `  contribution_bounds_per_group  ` : A named argument with a [contribution bound](#dp_clamped_named) . Performs clamping for each group separately before performing intermediate grouping on the privacy unit column.

**Return type**

`  FLOAT64  `

**Examples**

The following differentially private query gets the average number of each item requested per professor. Smaller aggregations might not be included. This query references a table called [`  professors  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#dp_example_tables) .

## Supplemental materials

### Clamp values in a differentially private aggregate function

In [differentially private queries](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#dp_clause) , aggregation clamping is used to limit the contribution of outliers. You can clamp explicitly or implicitly as follows:

  - [Clamp explicitly in the `  DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY  ` clause](#dp_clamped_named) .
  - [Clamp implicitly in the `  DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY  ` clause](#dp_clamped_named_implicit) .

#### Implicitly clamp values

If you don't include the contribution bounds named argument with the `  DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY  ` clause, clamping is implicit, which means bounds are derived from the data itself in a differentially private way.

Implicit bounding works best when computed using large datasets. For more information, see [Implicit bounding limitations for small datasets](/bigquery/docs/differential-privacy#implicit_limits) .

**Details**

In differentially private aggregate functions, explicit clamping is optional. If you don't include this clause, clamping is implicit, which means bounds are derived from the data itself in a differentially private way. The process is somewhat random, so aggregations with identical ranges can have different bounds.

Implicit bounds are determined for each aggregation. So if some aggregations have a wide range of values, and others have a narrow range of values, implicit bounding can identify different bounds for different aggregations as appropriate. Implicit bounds might be an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your use case. Different bounds for different aggregations can result in lower error. Different bounds also means that different aggregations have different levels of uncertainty, which might not be directly comparable. [Explicit bounds](#dp_clamped_named) , on the other hand, apply uniformly to all aggregations and should be derived from public information.

When clamping is implicit, part of the total epsilon is spent picking bounds. This leaves less epsilon for aggregations, so these aggregations are noisier.

#### Explicitly clamp values

``` text
contribution_bounds_per_group => (lower_bound,upper_bound)
```

``` text
contribution_bounds_per_row => (lower_bound,upper_bound)
```

Use the contribution bounds named argument to explicitly clamp values per group or per row between a lower and upper bound in a `  DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY  ` clause.

Input values:

  - `  contribution_bounds_per_row  ` : Contributions per privacy unit are clamped on a per-row (per-record) basis. This means the following:
      - Upper and lower bounds are applied to column values in individual rows produced by the input subquery independently.
      - The maximum possible contribution per privacy unit (and per grouping set) is the product of the per-row contribution limit and `  max_groups_contributed  ` differential privacy parameter.
  - `  contribution_bounds_per_group  ` : Contributions per privacy unit are clamped on a unique set of entity-specified `  GROUP BY  ` keys. The upper and lower bounds are applied to values per group after the values are aggregated per privacy unit.
  - `  lower_bound  ` : Numeric literal that represents the smallest value to include in an aggregation.
  - `  upper_bound  ` : Numeric literal that represents the largest value to include in an aggregation.

`  NUMERIC  ` and `  BIGNUMERIC  ` arguments aren't allowed.

**Details**

In differentially private aggregate functions, clamping explicitly clamps the total contribution from each privacy unit column to within a specified range.

Explicit bounds are uniformly applied to all aggregations. So even if some aggregations have a wide range of values, and others have a narrow range of values, the same bounds are applied to all of them. On the other hand, when [implicit bounds](#dp_clamped_named_implicit) are inferred from the data, the bounds applied to each aggregation can be different.

Explicit bounds should be chosen to reflect public information. For example, bounding ages between 0 and 100 reflects public information because the age of most people generally falls within this range.

**Important:** The results of the query reveal the explicit bounds. Don't use explicit bounds based on the entity data; explicit bounds should be based on public information.
