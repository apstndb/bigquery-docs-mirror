# The ML.ARIMA\_EVALUATE function

This document describes the `  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE  ` function, which you can use to evaluate the model metrics of `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` or `  ARIMA_PLUS_XREG  ` time series models.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL_NAME`,
  [, STRUCT(SHOW_ALL_CANDIDATE_MODELS AS show_all_candidate_models)])
```

**Note:** No input data is required.

### Arguments

`  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your project ID.

  - `  DATASET  ` : The BigQuery dataset that contains the model.

  - `  MODEL_NAME  ` : The name of the model.

  - `  SHOW_ALL_CANDIDATE_MODELS  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that indicates whether to show evaluation metrics or an error message for either all candidate models or for only the best model with the lowest [Akaike information criterion (AIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion) .
    
    When the `  SHOW_ALL_CANDIDATE_MODELS  ` argument value is `  FALSE  ` , the `  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE  ` function returns evaluation metrics for only the best model. When the `  SHOW_ALL_CANDIDATE_MODELS  ` argument value is `  TRUE  ` , metrics are returned for all candidate models, along with a possible fitting error on a setting of `  non_seasonal_p  ` , `  non_seasonal_d  ` , `  non_seasonal_q  ` , and `  drift  ` ; this applies to both single time series training with `  auto.ARIMA  ` and large-scale time series training cases.
    
    For large-scale time series forecasting training, regardless of the value of the `  SHOW_ALL_CANDIDATE_MODELS  ` argument, a single row is returned for a time series for which there is no a valid model. The error message explains the reason, and the values of all other columns are `  NULL  ` .
    
    For single time series `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` or `  ARIMA_PLUS_XREG  ` models, the default value is `  TRUE  ` . For large-scale time series `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` models, the default value is `  FALSE  ` .

## Output

`  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  time_series_id_col  ` or `  time_series_id_cols  ` : the identifiers of a time series. Only present when forecasting multiple time series at once. The column names and types are inherited from the `  TIME_SERIES_ID_COL  ` option as specified in the model creation query.

  - `  non_seasonal_p  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the order of the autoregressive part in a non-seasonal ARIMA model.

  - `  non_seasonal_d  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the degree of first differencing involved in a non-seasonal ARIMA model.

  - `  non_seasonal_q  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the order of the moving average part in a non-seasonal ARIMA model.

  - `  has_drift  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that indicates whether the model has drift.

  - `  log_likelihood  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the [log-likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function#Log-likelihood) of the model.

  - `  AIC  ` : the AIC of the model.

  - `  variance  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the variance of the model.

  - `  seasonal_periods  ` : an `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` value that contains one or more of the following values:
    
      - `  DAILY  `
      - `  WEEKLY  `
      - `  MONTHLY  `
      - `  QUARTERLY  `
      - `  YEARLY  `
      - `  NO_SEASONALITY  `

  - `  has_holiday_effect  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that indicates whether the history data has a holiday effect.

  - `  has_spikes_and_dips  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that indicates whether the history data has spikes and dips.

  - `  has_step_changes  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that indicates whether the model has step changes.

  - `  error_message  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the error message raised if any time series fail in the model.

The `  has_holiday_effect  ` , `  has_spikes_and_dips  ` , and `  has_step_changes  ` columns are only populated for `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` models that have `  decompose_time_series  ` enabled.

All of the columns are specific to the fitted `  ARIMA  ` models except for the following columns:

  - `  time_series_id_col  `
  - `  time_series_id_cols  `
  - `  seasonal_periods  `
  - `  has_holiday_effect  `
  - `  has_spikes_and_dips  `
  - `  has_step_changes  `

When the `  non_seasonal_d  ` value is not `  1  ` , `  has_drift  ` is set to `  FALSE  ` by default, because `  has_drift  ` doesn't apply in those cases.

## Example

The following example retrieves the evaluation metrics of the best model from the model `  mydataset.mymodel  ` in your default project:

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.ARIMA_EVALUATE(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`, STRUCT(FALSE AS show_all_candidate_models))
```
