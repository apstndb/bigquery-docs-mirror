# The ML.WEIGHTS function

This document describes the `  ML.WEIGHTS  ` function, which lets you see the underlying weights that a model uses during prediction. This function applies to [linear and logistic regression models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-glm) and [matrix factorization models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-matrix-factorization) .

For matrix factorization models, you can use the [`  AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-ai-generate-embedding) as an alternative to the `  ML.WEIGHTS  ` function. `  AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING  ` generates the same factor weights and intercept data as `  ML.WEIGHTS  ` as an array in a single column, rather than in two columns. Having all of the embeddings in a single column lets you directly use the [`  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/search_functions#vector_search) on the `  AI.GENERATE_EMBEDDING  ` output.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.WEIGHTS(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL`,
  STRUCT([, STANDARDIZE AS standardize]))
```

### Arguments

`  ML.WEIGHTS  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the model.
  - `  MODEL  ` : the name of the model.
  - `  STANDARDIZE  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that specifies whether the model weights should be standardized to assume that all features have a mean of `  0  ` and a standard deviation of `  1  ` . Standardizing the weights allows the absolute magnitude of the weights to be compared to each other. The default value is `  FALSE  ` . This argument only applies to linear and logistic regression models.

## Output

`  ML.WEIGHTS  ` has different output columns for different model types.

### Linear and logistic regression models

For linear and logistic regression models, `  ML.WEIGHTS  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  trial_id  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the hyperparameter tuning trial ID. This column is only returned if you ran hyperparameter tuning when creating the model.
  - `  processed_input  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the name of the feature input column. The value of this column matches the name of the feature column provided in the [`  query_statement  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#query_statement) that was used when the model was trained.
  - `  weight  ` : if the column identified by the `  processed_input  ` value is numerical, `  weight  ` contains a `  FLOAT64  ` value and the `  category_weights  ` column contains `  NULL  ` values. If the column identified by the `  processed_input  ` value is non-numerical and has been converted to one-hot encoding, the `  weight  ` column is `  NULL  ` and the `  category_weights  ` column contains the category names and weights for each category.
  - `  category_weights.category  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the category name if the column identified by the `  processed_input  ` value is non-numeric.
  - `  category_weights.weight  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` that contains the category's weight if the column identified by the `  processed_input  ` value is non-numeric.
  - `  class_label  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the label for a given weight. Only used for multiclass models. The output includes one row per `  <class_label, processed_input>  ` combination.

If you used the [`  TRANSFORM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform) in the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement that created the model, `  ML.WEIGHTS  ` outputs the weights of `  TRANSFORM  ` output features. The weights are denormalized by default, with the option to get normalized weights, exactly like models that are created without `  TRANSFORM  ` .

### Matrix factorization models

For matrix factorization models, `  ML.WEIGHTS  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  trial_id  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the hyperparameter tuning trial ID. This column is only returned if you ran hyperparameter tuning when creating the model.
  - `  processed_input  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the name of the user or item column. The value of this column matches the name of the user or item column provided in the [`  query_statement  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#query_statement) that was used when the model was trained.
  - `  feature  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the names of the specific users or items used during training.
  - `  factor_weights  ` : an `  ARRAY<STRUCT>  ` value that contains the factors and the weights for each factor.
      - `  factor_weights.factor  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the latent factor from training. This value can be between `  1  ` and the value of the [`  NUM_FACTORS  ` option](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-matrix-factorization#num_factors) .
      - `  factor_weights.weight  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the [weight](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#weight) of the respective factor and feature.
  - `  intercept  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the intercept or bias term for a feature.

There is an additional row in the output that contains the `  global__intercept__  ` value calculated from the input data. This row has `  NULL  ` values for the `  processed_input  ` and `  factor_weights  ` columns. For [implicit feedback](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-matrix-factorization#feedback_type) models, `  global__intercept__  ` is always 0.

## Examples

The following examples show how to use `  ML.WEIGHTS  ` with and without the `  standardize  ` argument.

### Without standardization

The following example retrieves weight information from `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` . The dataset is in your default project. It returns the weights that are associated with each one-hot encoded category for the input column `  input_col  ` .

``` text
SELECT
  category,
  weight
FROM
  UNNEST((
    SELECT
      category_weights
    FROM
      ML.WEIGHTS(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`)
    WHERE
      processed_input = 'input_col'))
```

This command uses the [`  UNNEST  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unnest_operator) function because the `  category_weights  ` column is a nested repeated column.

### With standardization

The following example retrieves weight information from `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` . The dataset is in your default project. It retrieves standardized weights, which assume all features have a mean of `  0  ` and a standard deviation of `  1  ` .

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.WEIGHTS(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`,
    STRUCT(true AS standardize))
```
