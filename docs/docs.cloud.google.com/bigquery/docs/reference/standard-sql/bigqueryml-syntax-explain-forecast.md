# The ML.EXPLAIN\_FORECAST function

This document describes the `  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function, which lets you generate forecasts that are based on a trained time series model. It only works on `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` models with the training option `  decompose_time_series  ` enabled or on `  ARIMA_PLUS_XREG  ` models. The `  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function encompasses the `  ML.FORECAST  ` function because its output is a superset of the results of `  ML.FORECAST  ` .

## Syntax

``` sql
# `ARIMA_PLUS` models:
ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL`,
  STRUCT(
    [HORIZON AS horizon]
    [, CONFIDENCE_LEVEL AS confidence_level]))

# `ARIMA_PLUS_XREG` model:
ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL`,
  STRUCT(
    [HORIZON AS horizon]
    [, CONFIDENCE_LEVEL AS confidence_level]),
    { TABLE `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.TABLE` | (QUERY_STATEMENT) })
```

**Note:** No input data is required for `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` models.

### Arguments

`  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the project that contains the resource.

  - `  DATASET  ` : the dataset that contains the resource.

  - `  MODEL  ` : the name of the model.

  - `  TABLE  ` : the name of the input table that contains the data to be evaluated.
    
    If `  TABLE  ` is specified, the input column names in the table must match the column names in the model, and their types should be compatible according to BigQuery [implicit coercion rules](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conversion_rules#coercion) .
    
    If there are unused columns from the table, they are ignored.
    
    The `  TABLE  ` argument is required for the `  ARIMA_PLUS_XREG  ` model.

  - `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` : the GoogleSQL query that is used to generate the evaluation data. For the supported SQL syntax for the `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` clause in GoogleSQL, see [Query syntax](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#sql_syntax) .
    
    If `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` is specified, the input column names from the query must match the column names in the model, and their types should be compatible according to BigQuery [implicit coercion rules](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conversion_rules#coercion) .

  - `  HORIZON  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies the number of time points to forecast. The maximum value is the horizon value specified in the [`  CREATE MODEL  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-time-series) statement for the time series model, or `  1000  ` if unspecified. The default value is `  3  ` . When forecasting multiple time series at the same time, this parameter applies to each time series.
    
    **Note:** Forecasting takes place when the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement runs. The `  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function retrieves the forecasting values and computes the prediction intervals. If you want to filter results when you're forecasting multiple time series, use the `  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function. To save query time, specify a value for the `  HORIZON  ` option in the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement.

  - `  CONFIDENCE_LEVEL  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that specifies the percentage of the future values that fall in the prediction interval. The valid input range is `  [0, 1)  ` . The default value is `  0.95  ` .

## Output

The `  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST  ` function returns the following columns:

  - `  time_series_id_col  ` or `  time_series_id_cols  ` : a value that contains the identifiers of a time series. `  time_series_id_col  ` can be an `  INT64  ` or `  STRING  ` value. `  time_series_id_cols  ` can be an `  ARRAY<INT64>  ` or `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` value. Only present when forecasting multiple time series at once. The column names and types are inherited from the `  TIME_SERIES_ID_COL  ` option as specified in the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement.

  - `  time_series_timestamp  ` : a `  TIMESTAMP  ` value that contains the timestamp of the time series. This column has a type of `  TIMESTAMP  ` regardless of the type of the input [`  time_series_timestamp_col  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-time-series#time_series_timestamp_col) . For each time series, the output rows are sorted in chronological order by the `  time_series_timestamp  ` value.

  - `  time_series_type  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains either `  history  ` or `  forecast  ` . The rows that have a value of `  history  ` in this column are used in training, either directly from the training table, or from interpolation using the training data.

  - `  time_series_data  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the data of the time series. For rows that have a value of `  history  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, `  time_series_data  ` is either the training data or the interpolated value using the training data. For rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, `  time_series_data  ` is the forecast value.

  - `  time_series_adjusted_data  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the adjusted data of the time series. For rows that have a value of `  history  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, this is the value after cleaning spikes and dips, adjusting the step changes, and removing the residuals. It is the aggregation of all the valid components: [holiday effect](#holiday_effect) , [seasonal components](#seasonal_components) , and [trend](#trend) . For rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, this is the forecast value, which is the same as the value of `  time_series_data  ` .

  - `  standard_error  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the standard error of the residuals during the ARIMA fitting. The values are the same for all rows that have a value of `  history  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column. For rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, this value increases with time, as the forecast values become less reliable.

  - `  confidence_level  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the user-specified confidence level or, if unspecified, the default value. This value is the same for all rows that have a value of `  history  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column. This value is `  NULL  ` for all rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column.

  - `  prediction_interval_lower_bound  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the lower bound of the prediction result. Only rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column have values other than `  NULL  ` in this column.

  - `  prediction_interval_upper_bound  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the upper bound of the prediction result. Only rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column have values other than `  NULL  ` in this column.

  - `  trend  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the long-term increase or decrease in the time series data.

  - `  seasonal_period_yearly  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the time series data value affected by the time of the year. This value is `  NULL  ` if no yearly effect is found.

  - `  seasonal_period_quarterly  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the time series data value affected by the time of the quarter. This value is `  NULL  ` if no quarterly effect is found.

  - `  seasonal_period_monthly  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the time series data value affected by the time of the month. This value is `  NULL  ` if no monthly effect is found.

  - `  seasonal_period_weekly  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the time series data value affected by the time of the week. This value is `  NULL  ` if no weekly effect is found.

  - `  seasonal_period_daily  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the time series data value affected by the time of the day. This value is `  NULL  ` if no daily effect is found.

  - `  holiday_effect  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the time series data value affected by different holidays. This is the sum of the maximum positive individual holiday effect and the minimum negative individual holiday effect. This is shown in the following formula, where \\(H\\) is the overall holiday effect and \\(h(i)\\) is the individual holiday effect:
    
    \\\[H=\\max\\limits\_{h(i)\>0} h(i) + \\min\\limits\_{h(i)\<0} h(i)\\\]
    
    This value is `  NULL  ` if no holiday effect is found.

  - `  spikes_and_dips  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the unexpectedly high or low values of the time series. For rows that have a value of `  history  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, the value is `  NULL  ` if no spike or dip is found. For rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, this value is `  NULL  ` .

  - `  step_changes  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the abrupt or structural change in the distributional properties of the time series. For rows that have a value of `  history  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, this value is `  NULL  ` if no step change is found. For rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, this value is `  NULL  ` .

  - `  residual  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the difference between the actual time series and the fitted time series after model training. The residual value is only meaningful for historical data. For rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, the `  residual  ` value is `  NULL  ` .

  - `  holiday_effect_ holiday_name  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the time series data value affected by the holiday that's identified in holiday\_name . If no holiday effect is found, this value is `  NULL  ` .
    
    There is one `  holiday_effect_ holiday_name  ` column for each holiday that's included in the model.

  - `  attribution_ feature_name  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the attribution of each feature to the final forecast. This only applies to `  ARIMAX_PLUS_XREG  ` models. The value is calculated by multiplying the weight of the feature with the feature value. This is shown in the following formula, where \\(\\beta\_{fn}\\) is the weight of feature `  fn  ` in the linear regression and \\(X\_{fn}\\) is the numericalized feature value:
    
    \\\[attribution\_{fn}=\\beta\_{fn} \* X\_{fn}\\\]

## Mathematical explanation

The mathematical relationship of the output columns is described in the following sections.

### `     time_series_data    `

The `  time_series_data  ` value is decomposed into several components to get better explainability. For `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` models, the component list includes the following components for better explainability:

  - `  trend  `
  - `  seasonal_period_yearly  `
  - `  seasonal_period_quarterly  `
  - `  seasonal_period_monthly  `
  - `  seasonal_period_weekly  `
  - `  seasonal_period_daily  `
  - `  holiday_effect  `
  - `  spikes_and_dips  `
  - `  step_changes  `
  - `  residual  `

For `  ARIMA_PLUS_XREG  ` models, this list also includes the feature contribution `  attribution_ feature_name  ` . For future data, the `  spikes_and_dips  ` , `  step_changes  ` , and `  residuals  ` values aren't applicable.

The following formulas show what components make up the `  time_series_data  ` value for historical and forecast data for time series models

  - For `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` models:
    
      - Historical data:
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    time_series_data = trend + seasonal_period_yearly + seasonal_period_quarterly + seasonal_period_monthly
                        + seasonal_period_weekly + seasonal_period_daily + holiday_effect
                        + spikes_and_dips + step_changes + residual
    ```
    
      - Forecast data:
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    time_series_data = trend + seasonal_period_yearly + seasonal_period_quarterly + seasonal_period_monthly
                      + seasonal_period_weekly + seasonal_period_daily + holiday_effect
    ```

  - For `  ARIMA_PLUS_XREG  ` models:
    
      - Historical data:
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    time_series_data = trend + seasonal_period_yearly + seasonal_period_quarterly + seasonal_period_monthly
                      + seasonal_period_weekly + seasonal_period_daily + holiday_effect
                      + spikes_and_dips + step_changes + residual
                      + (attribution_feature_1 + ... + attribution_feature_n)
    ```
    
      - Forecast data:
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    time_series_data = trend + seasonal_period_yearly + seasonal_period_quarterly + seasonal_period_monthly
                      + seasonal_period_weekly + seasonal_period_daily + holiday_effect
                      + (attribution_feature_1 + ... + attribution_feature_n)
    ```

### `     time_series_adjusted_data    `

The `  time_series_adjusted_data  ` value is the value that remains after cleaning spikes and dips, adjusting the step changes, and removing the residuals. Its formula is the same for both historical and forecast data.

  - For `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` models:
    
    ``` text
    time_series_adjusted_data = trend + seasonal_period_yearly + seasonal_period_quarterly
                                + seasonal_period_monthly + seasonal_period_weekly + seasonal_period_daily
                                + holiday_effect
    ```

  - For `  ARIMA_PLUS_XREG  ` models:
    
    ``` text
    time_series_adjusted_data = trend + seasonal_period_yearly + seasonal_period_quarterly
                                + seasonal_period_monthly + seasonal_period_weekly + seasonal_period_daily
                                + holiday_effect + (attribution_feature_1 + ... + attribution_feature_n)
    ```

**Note:** For rows that have a value of `  forecast  ` in the `  time_series_type  ` column, you might notice that the `  time_series_data  ` and `  time_series_adjusted_data  ` values are the same .

### `     holiday_effect    `

The `  holiday_effect_ holiday_name  ` value is a subcomponent . The `  holiday_effect  ` value is the sum of all the `  holiday_effect_ holiday_name  ` values. For example, if you specify holidays `  xmas  ` and `  mlk  ` , the formula is `  holiday_effect = holiday_effect_xmas + holiday_effect_mlk  ` .

## `     ARIMA_PLUS    ` example

The following example forecasts 30 time points with a confidence level of `  0.8  ` :

``` text

  *
FROM
  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`,
    STRUCT(30 AS horizon, 0.8 AS confidence_level))
```

## `     ARIMA_PLUS_XREG    ` example

The following example forecasts 30 time points with a confidence level of `  0.8  ` with future features:

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EXPLAIN_FORECAST(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`,
    STRUCT(30 AS horizon, 0.8 AS confidence_level),
    (SELECT * FROM `mydataset.mytable`))
```
