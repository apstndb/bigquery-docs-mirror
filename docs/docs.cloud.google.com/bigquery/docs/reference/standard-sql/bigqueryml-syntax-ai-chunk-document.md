# The AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT function

This document describes the `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` function, a table-valued function that splits unstructured documents into semantically coherent text chunks based on document layout and structure.

The `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` function uses the [Document AI layout parser](https://docs.cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/layout-parse-chunk) to analyze document structure, including headings, sections, paragraphs, lists, and tables. It preserves semantic context across structural boundaries to generate chunks that are optimized for vector embedding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. This function has the following benefits:

- BigQuery automatically provisions and manages a Document AI layout parser; you don't have to create or train a model.
- The function uses a single processor per project, which prevents redundant provisioning across queries.
- You can use documents stored in Cloud Storage by specifying their URI path patterns, such as `'gs://bucket/folder/*.pdf'` .
- The function splits documents into semantically coherent chunks, rather than arbitrarily by character or word count.

The following query shows how to chunk a document stored in a Cloud Storage bucket:

```
SELECT *
FROM AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT('gs://cloud-samples-data/documentai/SampleDocuments/OCR_PROCESSOR/Winnie_the_Pooh_3_Pages.pdf');
```

## Details

To use the `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` function, you must enable the Document AI API ( `documentai.googleapis.com` ). When you run `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` , BigQuery automatically creates a Document AI layout parser processor named `bq-created-layout-parser` in your project if one doesn't already exist.

The `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` function accepts the following input sources:

- A Cloud Storage URI string literal with optional wildcard matching.
- An object table.
- A subquery that contains an `ObjectRef` column named `ref` .

The `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` function supports the [file formats](https://docs.cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/layout-parse-chunk#parser-types) handled by the Document AI layout parser and is subject to the [layout parser limitations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/layout-parse-chunk#limitations) .

## Syntax

```
AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT(
  { 'STORAGE_URI' | TABLE INPUT_TABLE | (QUERY_STATEMENT) }
  [, connection_id => 'CONNECTION_ID' ]
  [, chunk_size => CHUNK_SIZE ]
)
```

### Arguments

The `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` function takes the following arguments:

- `STORAGE_URI` : A `STRING` literal that specifies the Cloud Storage URI to list and chunk objects from. You can use a single wildcard character ( `*` ) at the end of a directory path, such as `'gs://my-bucket/docs/*'` , or you can filter by a file extension, such as `'gs://my-bucket/docs/*.pdf'` . When you specify a URI, you must authenticate with your end-user credentials (EUC). For more information, read about [authentication with EUC](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-ai-chunk-document#euc) .

- `TABLE `` INPUT_TABLE` : The name of an existing table or object table that contains an [`ObjectRef` column](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/work-with-objectref) named `ref` . When you use an object table, the `connection_id` argument is required and must match the connection ID configured on the object table. If you use a standard table, the `connection_id` argument must match the authorizer of the `ObjectRef` column. For more information, read about [authentication with a connection](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-ai-chunk-document#connection) .

- `QUERY_STATEMENT` : A subquery that returns an `ObjectRef` column named `ref` .

  - If the `ObjectRef` value has an authorizer, it must match the `connection_id` value.
  - If the `ObjectRef` value doesn't have an authorizer, omit the `connection_id` argument.

- `CONNECTION_ID` : A `STRING` value that specifies the BigQuery Cloud resource connection ID used to authenticate to Document AI and access Cloud Storage, in the format `[ `` PROJECT_ID `` .] `` LOCATION `` . `` CONNECTION_ID` or `projects/ `` PROJECT_ID `` /locations/ `` LOCATION `` /connections/ `` CONNECTION_ID` . For example, `'myproject.us.my_connection'` . If omitted, BigQuery uses EUC by default. For more information, read about [authentication](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-ai-chunk-document#authentication) .

- `CHUNK_SIZE` : An `INT64` value that specifies the target maximum chunk size, measured in tokens. The value must be between `1` and `2000` . The default value is `1000` .

## Authentication

The following sections describe how to authenticate with end-user credentials (EUC) or a Cloud resource connection.

### End-user credentials (EUC)

To authenticate using EUC, you must have the following roles:

- To create and use the `bq-created-layout-parser` processor, you must have the **Document AI Editor** ( `roles/documentai.editor` ) role on the project. If the processor already exists in the project, then you only need the **Document AI Viewer** ( `roles/documentai.viewer` ) role.
- You must have the **Storage Object Viewer** ( `roles/storage.objectViewer` ) or **Storage Object User** ( `roles/storage.objectUser` ) role on the Cloud Storage bucket that contains the documents.

### Cloud resource connection

If you authenticate using a Cloud resource connection, you and your connection's service account must have the following roles:

- To create and invoke the `bq-created-layout-parser` processor, grant the connection's service account the **Document AI Editor** ( `roles/documentai.editor` ) role on the project. If the processor already exists in the project, the service account only needs the **Document AI Viewer** ( `roles/documentai.viewer` ) role.
- Grant the connection's service account the **Storage Object Viewer** ( `roles/storage.objectViewer` ) role on the Cloud Storage bucket containing the documents.
- You must have the **BigQuery Connection User** ( `roles/bigquery.connectionUser` ) role on the connection.

## Output

The `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` function returns the following columns:

- `chunk_id` : an `INT64` value containing the 1-based sequential index of the chunk within the document.
- `start_page` : an `INT64` value containing the 1-based starting page number of the chunk in the source document.
- `end_page` : an `INT64` value containing the 1-based ending page number of the chunk in the source document.
- `content` : a `STRING` value containing the extracted text content of the chunk.
- `status` : a `STRING` value containing the execution status for the document or chunk. An empty string indicates successful processing. Processing might fail because a file is unreadable, corrupt, or too large. If processing fails, the status contains the error code and message, such as `INVALID_ARGUMENT` or `PERMISSION_DENIED` .
- `uri` : a `STRING` value that contains the Cloud Storage URI of the object.
- `generation` : an `INT64` value that contains a unique identifier for the object's version.
- `content_type` : a `STRING` value that contains the MIME type of the object, for example, `image/jpeg` or `application/pdf` .
- `size` : an `INT64` value that contains the object size in bytes.
- `md5_hash` : a `STRING` value that contains the MD5 hash of the object.
- `updated` : a `TIMESTAMP` value that contains the time the object was last updated.
- `metadata` : an `ARRAY<STRUCT<name STRING, value STRING>>` value that contains additional Cloud Storage metadata.
- `ref` : an `ObjectRef` value that represents the Cloud Storage object.

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` .

### Chunk documents using a Cloud Storage URI

The following query parses and chunks a PDF file directly from a Cloud Storage bucket:

```
SELECT
  chunk_id,
  start_page,
  end_page,
  content
FROM
  AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT(
    'gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/documents/crittercuisine_5000_user_manual.pdf'
  );
```

The output is similar to the following:

```
+----------+------------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------------+
| chunk_id | start_page | end_page | content                                                        |

```

### Chunk documents using an `OBJ.LIST` subquery and a connection

When documents require specific connection credentials to access Cloud Storage, use a subquery that calls the [`OBJ.LIST` table function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/objectref_functions#objlist) and specify the `connection_id` parameter. Make sure to use the same connection ID in both `OBJ.LIST` and `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` . The following query shows how to parse each page of the Critter Cuisine user manual by using the `OBJ.LIST` function with `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` :

```
SELECT
  chunk_id,
  start_page,
  end_page,
  content,
  ref.uri
FROM
  AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT(
    (SELECT ref
     FROM OBJ.LIST(
       'gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/document_chunks/*.pdf',
       'us.example_connection')),
    connection_id => 'us.example_connection',
    chunk_size => 250
  );
```

The output is similar to the following:

```
+----------+------------+----------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| chunk_id | start_page | end_page | content                                      | uri                                               |

+----------+------------+----------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
```

### Chunk documents using an `ObjectRef` column

You can pass an `ObjectRef` column into `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` . You can create an `ObjectRef` value by passing a Cloud Storage URI to the [`OBJ.MAKE_REF` function](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/objectref_functions#objmake_ref) or by using an `ObjectRef` column from a table.

The following query shows how to parse a PDF file into chunks by using the `OBJ.MAKE_REF` function and EUC authentication:

```
SELECT
  chunk_id,
  start_page,
  end_page,
  content
FROM
  AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT(
    (SELECT OBJ.MAKE_REF(
       'gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/documents/crittercuisine_5000_user_manual.pdf') AS ref)
  );
```

The following query shows how to parse multiple PDF files stored in an object table. The connection specified in `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` is required and must match the connection used to create the object table.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE cymbal_pets.product_manual
WITH CONNECTION us.example_connection
OPTIONS (
  object_metadata = 'SIMPLE',
  uris = ['gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/tutorials/cymbal-pets/document_chunks/*.pdf']
);

SELECT *
FROM AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT(TABLE cymbal_pets.product_manual, connection_id => 'us.example_connection');
```

## Pricing

Document processing with `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` uses the Document AI Layout Parser API, which is billed per processed page according to standard [Document AI pricing](https://docs.cloud.google.com/document-ai/pricing) .

There is no idle holding fee for maintaining this processor. If you delete the `bq-created-layout-parser` processor from the Google Cloud console, BigQuery automatically recreates it the next time you run `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` .

BigQuery query slot usage is billed normally.

## Locations

The `AI.CHUNK_DOCUMENT` function is supported in the `US` and `EU` multi-regions, and in all single regions within the US and EU except `europe-west2` and `europe-west6` .
