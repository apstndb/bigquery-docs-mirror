## `     SELECT    ` statement

``` text
SELECT
  [ WITH differential_privacy_clause ]
  [ { ALL | DISTINCT } ]
  [ AS { STRUCT | VALUE } ]
  select_list

select_list:
  { select_all | select_expression } [, ...]

select_all:
  [ expression. ]*
  [ EXCEPT ( column_name [, ...] ) ]
  [ REPLACE ( expression AS column_name [, ...] ) ]

select_expression:
  expression [ [ AS ] alias ]
```

The `  SELECT  ` list defines the columns that the query will return. Expressions in the `  SELECT  ` list can refer to columns in any of the `  from_item  ` s in its corresponding `  FROM  ` clause.

Each item in the `  SELECT  ` list is one of:

  - `  *  `
  - `  expression  `
  - `  expression.*  `

### `     SELECT *    `

`  SELECT *  ` , often referred to as *select star* , produces one output column for each column that's visible after executing the full query.

``` text
SELECT * FROM (SELECT "apple" AS fruit, "carrot" AS vegetable);

/*-------+-----------+
 | fruit | vegetable |
 +-------+-----------+
 | apple | carrot    |
 +-------+-----------*/
```

### `     SELECT expression    `

Items in a `  SELECT  ` list can be expressions. These expressions evaluate to a single value and produce one output column, with an optional explicit `  alias  ` .

If the expression doesn't have an explicit alias, it receives an implicit alias according to the rules for [implicit aliases](#implicit_aliases) , if possible. Otherwise, the column is anonymous and you can't refer to it by name elsewhere in the query.

### `     SELECT expression.*    `

An item in a `  SELECT  ` list can also take the form of `  expression.*  ` . This produces one output column for each column or top-level field of `  expression  ` . The expression must either be a table alias or evaluate to a single value of a data type with fields, such as a STRUCT.

The following query produces one output column for each column in the table `  groceries  ` , aliased as `  g  ` .

``` text
WITH groceries AS
  (SELECT "milk" AS dairy,
   "eggs" AS protein,
   "bread" AS grain)
SELECT g.*
FROM groceries AS g;

/*-------+---------+-------+
 | dairy | protein | grain |
 +-------+---------+-------+
 | milk  | eggs    | bread |
 +-------+---------+-------*/
```

More examples:

``` text
WITH locations AS
  (SELECT STRUCT("Seattle" AS city, "Washington" AS state) AS location
  UNION ALL
  SELECT STRUCT("Phoenix" AS city, "Arizona" AS state) AS location)
SELECT l.location.*
FROM locations l;

/*---------+------------+
 | city    | state      |
 +---------+------------+
 | Seattle | Washington |
 | Phoenix | Arizona    |
 +---------+------------*/
```

``` text
WITH locations AS
  (SELECT ARRAY<STRUCT<city STRING, state STRING>>[("Seattle", "Washington"),
    ("Phoenix", "Arizona")] AS location)
SELECT l.LOCATION[offset(0)].*
FROM locations l;

/*---------+------------+
 | city    | state      |
 +---------+------------+
 | Seattle | Washington |
 +---------+------------*/
```

### `     SELECT * EXCEPT    `

A `  SELECT * EXCEPT  ` statement specifies the names of one or more columns to exclude from the result. All matching column names are omitted from the output.

``` text
WITH orders AS
  (SELECT 5 as order_id,
  "sprocket" as item_name,
  200 as quantity)
SELECT * EXCEPT (order_id)
FROM orders;

/*-----------+----------+
 | item_name | quantity |
 +-----------+----------+
 | sprocket  | 200      |
 +-----------+----------*/
```

**Note:** `  SELECT * EXCEPT  ` doesn't exclude columns that don't have names.

### `     SELECT * REPLACE    `

A `  SELECT * REPLACE  ` statement specifies one or more `  expression AS identifier  ` clauses. Each identifier must match a column name from the `  SELECT *  ` statement. In the output column list, the column that matches the identifier in a `  REPLACE  ` clause is replaced by the expression in that `  REPLACE  ` clause.

A `  SELECT * REPLACE  ` statement doesn't change the names or order of columns. However, it can change the value and the value type.

``` text
WITH orders AS
  (SELECT 5 as order_id,
  "sprocket" as item_name,
  200 as quantity)
SELECT * REPLACE ("widget" AS item_name)
FROM orders;

/*----------+-----------+----------+
 | order_id | item_name | quantity |
 +----------+-----------+----------+
 | 5        | widget    | 200      |
 +----------+-----------+----------*/

WITH orders AS
  (SELECT 5 as order_id,
  "sprocket" as item_name,
  200 as quantity)
SELECT * REPLACE (quantity/2 AS quantity)
FROM orders;

/*----------+-----------+----------+
 | order_id | item_name | quantity |
 +----------+-----------+----------+
 | 5        | sprocket  | 100      |
 +----------+-----------+----------*/
```

**Note:** `  SELECT * REPLACE  ` doesn't replace columns that don't have names.

### `     SELECT DISTINCT    `

A `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` statement discards duplicate rows and returns only the remaining rows. `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` can't return columns of the following types:

In the following example, `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` is used to produce distinct arrays:

``` text
WITH PlayerStats AS (
  SELECT ['Coolidge', 'Adams'] as Name, 3 as PointsScored UNION ALL
  SELECT ['Adams', 'Buchanan'], 0 UNION ALL
  SELECT ['Coolidge', 'Adams'], 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT ['Kiran', 'Noam'], 1)
SELECT DISTINCT Name
FROM PlayerStats;

/*------------------+
 | Name             |
 +------------------+
 | [Coolidge,Adams] |
 | [Adams,Buchanan] |
 | [Kiran,Noam]     |
 +------------------*/
```

In the following example, `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` is used to produce distinct structs:

``` text
WITH
  PlayerStats AS (
    SELECT
      STRUCT<last_name STRING, first_name STRING, age INT64>(
        'Adams', 'Noam', 20) AS Player,
      3 AS PointsScored UNION ALL
    SELECT ('Buchanan', 'Jie', 19), 0 UNION ALL
    SELECT ('Adams', 'Noam', 20), 4 UNION ALL
    SELECT ('Buchanan', 'Jie', 19), 13
  )
SELECT DISTINCT Player
FROM PlayerStats;

/*--------------------------+
 | player                   |
 +--------------------------+
 | {                        |
 |   last_name: "Adams",    |
 |   first_name: "Noam",    |
 |   age: 20                |
 |  }                       |
 +--------------------------+
 | {                        |
 |   last_name: "Buchanan", |
 |   first_name: "Jie",     |
 |   age: 19                |
 |  }                       |
 +---------------------------*/
```

### `     SELECT ALL    `

A `  SELECT ALL  ` statement returns all rows, including duplicate rows. `  SELECT ALL  ` is the default behavior of `  SELECT  ` .

### `     SELECT AS STRUCT    `

``` text
SELECT AS STRUCT expr [[AS] struct_field_name1] [,...]
```

This produces a [value table](#value_tables) with a STRUCT row type, where the STRUCT field names and types match the column names and types produced in the `  SELECT  ` list.

Example:

``` text
SELECT ARRAY(SELECT AS STRUCT 1 a, 2 b)
```

`  SELECT AS STRUCT  ` can be used in a scalar or array subquery to produce a single STRUCT type grouping multiple values together. Scalar and array subqueries (see [Subqueries](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries) ) are normally not allowed to return multiple columns, but can return a single column with STRUCT type.

### `     SELECT AS VALUE    `

`  SELECT AS VALUE  ` produces a [value table](#value_tables) from any `  SELECT  ` list that produces exactly one column. Instead of producing an output table with one column, possibly with a name, the output will be a value table where the row type is just the value type that was produced in the one `  SELECT  ` column. Any alias the column had will be discarded in the value table.

Example:

``` text
SELECT AS VALUE STRUCT(1 AS a, 2 AS b) xyz
```

The query above produces a table with row type `  STRUCT<a int64, b int64>  ` .

## `     FROM    ` clause

``` text
FROM from_clause[, ...]

from_clause:
  from_item
  [ { pivot_operator | unpivot_operator | match_recognize_clause } ]
  [ tablesample_operator ]

from_item:
  {
    table_name [ as_alias ] [ FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF timestamp_expression ] 
    | { join_operation | ( join_operation ) }
    | ( query_expr ) [ as_alias ]
    | field_path
    | unnest_operator
    | cte_name [ as_alias ]
  }

as_alias:
  [ AS ] alias
```

The `  FROM  ` clause indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve rows, and specifies how to join those rows together to produce a single stream of rows for processing in the rest of the query.

#### `     pivot_operator    `

See [PIVOT operator](#pivot_operator) .

#### `     unpivot_operator    `

See [UNPIVOT operator](#unpivot_operator) .

#### `     tablesample_operator    `

See [TABLESAMPLE operator](#tablesample_operator) .

#### `     match_recognize_clause    `

See [MATCH\_RECOGNIZE clause](#match_recognize_clause) .

#### `     table_name    `

The name (optionally qualified) of an existing table.

``` text
SELECT * FROM Roster;
SELECT * FROM dataset.Roster;
SELECT * FROM project.dataset.Roster;
```

#### `     FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF    `

`  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  ` references the historical versions of the table definition and rows that were current at `  timestamp_expression  ` .

Limitations:

The source table in the `  FROM  ` clause containing `  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  ` must not be any of the following:

  - An array scan, including a [flattened array](/bigquery/docs/arrays#flattening_arrays) or the output of the `  UNNEST  ` operator.
  - A common table expression defined by a `  WITH  ` clause.
  - The source table in a `  CREATE TABLE FUNCTION  ` statement creating a new table-valued function

`  timestamp_expression  ` must be a constant expression. It can't contain the following:

  - Subqueries.
  - Correlated references (references to columns of a table that appear at a higher level of the query statement, such as in the `  SELECT  ` list).
  - User-defined functions (UDFs).

The value of `  timestamp_expression  ` can't fall into the following ranges:

  - After the current timestamp (in the future).
  - More than seven (7) days before the current timestamp.

A single query statement can't reference a single table at more than one point in time, including the current time. That is, a query can reference a table multiple times at the same timestamp, but not the current version and a historical version, or two different historical versions.

**Note:** DML statements always operate on the current version of the destination table, so if the destination table is used multiple times in the query, all of them must use the current version.

The default time zone for `  timestamp_expression  ` in a `  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  ` expression is `  America/Los_Angeles  ` , even though the default time zone for timestamp literals is `  UTC  ` .

Examples:

The following query returns a historical version of the table from one hour ago.

``` text
SELECT *
FROM t
  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 HOUR);
```

The following query returns a historical version of the table at an absolute point in time.

``` text
SELECT *
FROM t
  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF '2017-01-01 10:00:00-07:00';
```

The following query returns an error because the `  timestamp_expression  ` contains a correlated reference to a column in the containing query.

``` text
SELECT *
FROM t1
WHERE t1.a IN (SELECT t2.a
               FROM t2 FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF t1.timestamp_column);
```

The following operations show accessing a historical version of the table before table is replaced.

``` text
DECLARE before_replace_timestamp TIMESTAMP;

-- Create table books.
CREATE TABLE books AS
SELECT 'Hamlet' title, 'William Shakespeare' author;

-- Get current timestamp before table replacement.
SET before_replace_timestamp = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP();

-- Replace table with different schema(title and release_date).
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE books AS
SELECT 'Hamlet' title, DATE '1603-01-01' release_date;

-- This query returns Hamlet, William Shakespeare as result.
SELECT * FROM books FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF before_replace_timestamp;
```

The following operations show accessing a historical version of the table before a DML job.

``` text
DECLARE JOB_START_TIMESTAMP TIMESTAMP;

-- Create table books.
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE books AS
SELECT 'Hamlet' title, 'William Shakespeare' author;

-- Insert two rows into the books.
INSERT books (title, author)
VALUES('The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fizgerald'),
      ('War and Peace', 'Leo Tolstoy');

SELECT * FROM books;

SET JOB_START_TIMESTAMP = (
  SELECT start_time
  FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_USER
  WHERE job_type="QUERY"
    AND statement_type="INSERT"
  ORDER BY start_time DESC
  LIMIT 1
 );

-- This query only returns Hamlet, William Shakespeare as result.
SELECT * FROM books FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF JOB_START_TIMESTAMP;
```

The following query returns an error because the DML operates on the current version of the table, and a historical version of the table from one day ago.

``` text
INSERT INTO t1
SELECT * FROM t1
  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 1 DAY);
```

#### `     join_operation    `

See [Join operation](#join_types) .

#### `     query_expr    `

`  ( query_expr ) [ [ AS ] alias ]  ` is a [table subquery](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries#table_subquery_concepts) .

#### `     field_path    `

In the `  FROM  ` clause, `  field_path  ` is any path that resolves to a field within a data type. `  field_path  ` can go arbitrarily deep into a nested data structure.

Some examples of valid `  field_path  ` values include:

``` text
SELECT * FROM T1 t1, t1.array_column;

SELECT * FROM T1 t1, t1.struct_column.array_field;

SELECT (SELECT ARRAY_AGG(c) FROM t1.array_column c) FROM T1 t1;

SELECT a.struct_field1 FROM T1 t1, t1.array_of_structs a;

SELECT (SELECT STRING_AGG(a.struct_field1) FROM t1.array_of_structs a) FROM T1 t1;
```

Field paths in the `  FROM  ` clause must end in an array field. In addition, field paths can't contain arrays before the end of the path. For example, the path `  array_column.some_array.some_array_field  ` is invalid because it contains an array before the end of the path.

**Note:** If a path has only one name, it's interpreted as a table. To work around this, wrap the path using `  UNNEST  ` , or use the fully-qualified path.

**Note:** If a path has more than one name, and it matches a field name, it's interpreted as a field name. To force the path to be interpreted as a table name, wrap the path using ``  `  `` .

#### `     unnest_operator    `

See [UNNEST operator](#unnest_operator) .

#### `     cte_name    `

Common table expressions (CTEs) in a [`  WITH  ` Clause](#with_clause) act like temporary tables that you can reference anywhere in the `  FROM  ` clause. In the example below, `  subQ1  ` and `  subQ2  ` are CTEs.

Example:

``` text
WITH
  subQ1 AS (SELECT * FROM Roster WHERE SchoolID = 52),
  subQ2 AS (SELECT SchoolID FROM subQ1)
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM subQ2;
```

The `  WITH  ` clause hides any permanent tables with the same name for the duration of the query, unless you qualify the table name, for example:

`  dataset.Roster  ` or `  project.dataset.Roster  ` .

## `     UNNEST    ` operator

``` text
unnest_operator:
  {
    UNNEST( array ) [ as_alias ]
    | array_path [ as_alias ]
  }
  [ WITH OFFSET [ as_alias ] ]

array:
  { array_expression | array_path }

as_alias:
  [AS] alias
```

The `  UNNEST  ` operator takes an array and returns a table with one row for each element in the array. The output of `  UNNEST  ` is one [value table](#value_tables) column. For these `  ARRAY  ` element types, `  SELECT *  ` against the value table column returns multiple columns:

  - `  STRUCT  `

Input values:

  - `  array_expression  ` : An expression that produces an array and that's not an array path.

  - `  array_path  ` : The path to an `  ARRAY  ` type.
    
      - In an implicit `  UNNEST  ` operation, the path must start with a [range variable](#range_variables) name.
      - In an explicit `  UNNEST  ` operation, the path can optionally start with a [range variable](#range_variables) name.
    
    The `  UNNEST  ` operation with any [correlated](#correlated_join) `  array_path  ` must be on the right side of a `  CROSS JOIN  ` , `  LEFT JOIN  ` , or `  INNER JOIN  ` operation.

  - `  as_alias  ` : If specified, defines the explicit name of the value table column containing the array element values. It can be used to refer to the column elsewhere in the query.

  - `  WITH OFFSET  ` : `  UNNEST  ` destroys the order of elements in the input array. Use this optional clause to return an additional column with the array element indexes, or *offsets* . Offset counting starts at zero for each row produced by the `  UNNEST  ` operation. This column has an optional alias; If the optional alias isn't used, the default column name is `  offset  ` .
    
    Example:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT * FROM UNNEST ([10,20,30]) as numbers WITH OFFSET;
    
    /*---------+--------+
     | numbers | offset |
     +---------+--------+
     | 10      | 0      |
     | 20      | 1      |
     | 30      | 2      |
     +---------+--------*/
    ```

You can also use `  UNNEST  ` outside of the `  FROM  ` clause with the [`  IN  ` operator](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#in_operators) .

For several ways to use `  UNNEST  ` , including construction, flattening, and filtering, see [Work with arrays](/bigquery/docs/arrays) .

To learn more about the ways you can use `  UNNEST  ` explicitly and implicitly, see [Explicit and implicit `  UNNEST  `](#explicit_implicit_unnest) .

### `     UNNEST    ` and structs

For an input array of structs, `  UNNEST  ` returns a row for each struct, with a separate column for each field in the struct. The alias for each column is the name of the corresponding struct field.

Example:

``` text
SELECT *
FROM UNNEST(
  ARRAY<
    STRUCT<
      x INT64,
      y STRING,
      z STRUCT<a INT64, b INT64>>>[
        (1, 'foo', (10, 11)),
        (3, 'bar', (20, 21))]);

/*---+-----+----------+
 | x | y   | z        |
 +---+-----+----------+
 | 1 | foo | {10, 11} |
 | 3 | bar | {20, 21} |
 +---+-----+----------*/
```

Because the `  UNNEST  ` operator returns a [value table](#value_tables) , you can alias `  UNNEST  ` to define a range variable that you can reference elsewhere in the query. If you reference the range variable in the `  SELECT  ` list, the query returns a struct containing all of the fields of the original struct in the input table.

Example:

``` text
SELECT *, struct_value
FROM UNNEST(
  ARRAY<
    STRUCT<
    x INT64,
    y STRING>>[
      (1, 'foo'),
      (3, 'bar')]) AS struct_value;

/*---+-----+--------------+
 | x | y   | struct_value |
 +---+-----+--------------+
 | 3 | bar | {3, bar}     |
 | 1 | foo | {1, foo}     |
 +---+-----+--------------*/
```

### Explicit and implicit `     UNNEST    `

Array unnesting can be either explicit or implicit. To learn more, see the following sections.

#### Explicit unnesting

The `  UNNEST  ` keyword is required in explicit unnesting. For example:

``` text
WITH Coordinates AS (SELECT [1,2] AS position)
SELECT results FROM Coordinates, UNNEST(Coordinates.position) AS results;
```

This example and the following examples use the `  array_path  ` called `  Coordinates.position  ` to illustrate unnesting.

#### Implicit unnesting

The `  UNNEST  ` keyword isn't used in implicit unnesting.

For example:

``` text
WITH Coordinates AS (SELECT [1,2] AS position)
SELECT results FROM Coordinates, Coordinates.position AS results;
```

##### Tables and implicit unnesting

When you use `  array_path  ` with implicit `  UNNEST  ` , `  array_path  ` must be prepended with the table. For example:

``` text
WITH Coordinates AS (SELECT [1,2] AS position)
SELECT results FROM Coordinates, Coordinates.position AS results;
```

### `     UNNEST    ` and `     NULL    ` values

`  UNNEST  ` treats `  NULL  ` values as follows:

  - `  NULL  ` and empty arrays produce zero rows.
  - An array containing `  NULL  ` values produces rows containing `  NULL  ` values.

## `     PIVOT    ` operator

``` text
FROM from_item[, ...] pivot_operator

pivot_operator:
  PIVOT(
    aggregate_function_call [as_alias][, ...]
    FOR input_column
    IN ( pivot_column [as_alias][, ...] )
  ) [AS alias]

as_alias:
  [AS] alias
```

The `  PIVOT  ` operator rotates rows into columns, using aggregation. `  PIVOT  ` is part of the `  FROM  ` clause.

  - `  PIVOT  ` can be used to modify any table expression.
  - Combining `  PIVOT  ` with `  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  ` isn't allowed, although users may use `  PIVOT  ` against a subquery input which itself uses `  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  ` .
  - A `  WITH OFFSET  ` clause immediately preceding the `  PIVOT  ` operator isn't allowed.

Conceptual example:

``` text
-- Before PIVOT is used to rotate sales and quarter into Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 columns:
/*---------+-------+---------+------+
 | product | sales | quarter | year |
 +---------+-------+---------+------|
 | Kale    | 51    | Q1      | 2020 |
 | Kale    | 23    | Q2      | 2020 |
 | Kale    | 45    | Q3      | 2020 |
 | Kale    | 3     | Q4      | 2020 |
 | Kale    | 70    | Q1      | 2021 |
 | Kale    | 85    | Q2      | 2021 |
 | Apple   | 77    | Q1      | 2020 |
 | Apple   | 0     | Q2      | 2020 |
 | Apple   | 1     | Q1      | 2021 |
 +---------+-------+---------+------*/

-- After PIVOT is used to rotate sales and quarter into Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 columns:
/*---------+------+----+------+------+------+
 | product | year | Q1 | Q2   | Q3   | Q4   |
 +---------+------+----+------+------+------+
 | Apple   | 2020 | 77 | 0    | NULL | NULL |
 | Apple   | 2021 | 1  | NULL | NULL | NULL |
 | Kale    | 2020 | 51 | 23   | 45   | 3    |
 | Kale    | 2021 | 70 | 85   | NULL | NULL |
 +---------+------+----+------+------+------*/
```

**Definitions**

Top-level definitions:

  - `  from_item  ` : The table, subquery, or table-valued function (TVF) on which to perform a pivot operation. The `  from_item  ` must [follow these rules](#rules_for_pivot_from_item) .
  - `  pivot_operator  ` : The pivot operation to perform on a `  from_item  ` .
  - `  alias  ` : An alias to use for an item in the query.

`  pivot_operator  ` definitions:

  - `  aggregate_function_call  ` : An aggregate function call that aggregates all input rows such that `  input_column  ` matches a particular value in `  pivot_column  ` . Each aggregation corresponding to a different `  pivot_column  ` value produces a different column in the output. [Follow these rules](#rules_for_pivot_agg_function) when creating an aggregate function call.
  - `  input_column  ` : Takes a column and retrieves the row values for the column, [following these rules](#rules_input_column) .
  - `  pivot_column  ` : A pivot column to create for each aggregate function call. If an alias isn't provided, a default alias is created. A pivot column value type must match the value type in `  input_column  ` so that the values can be compared. It's possible to have a value in `  pivot_column  ` that doesn't match a value in `  input_column  ` . Must be a constant and [follow these rules](#rules_pivot_column) .

**Rules**

Rules for a `  from_item  ` passed to `  PIVOT  ` :

  - The `  from_item  ` may consist of any table, subquery, or table-valued function (TVF) result.
  - The `  from_item  ` may not produce a value table.
  - The `  from_item  ` may not be a subquery using `  SELECT AS STRUCT  ` .

Rules for `  aggregate_function_call  ` :

  - Must be an aggregate function. For example, `  SUM  ` .
  - You may reference columns in a table passed to `  PIVOT  ` , as well as correlated columns, but may not access columns defined by the `  PIVOT  ` clause itself.
  - A table passed to `  PIVOT  ` may be accessed through its alias if one is provided.
  - You can only use an aggregate function that takes one argument.
  - Except for `  COUNT  ` , you can only use aggregate functions that ignore `  NULL  ` inputs.
  - If you are using `  COUNT  ` , you can use `  *  ` as an argument.

Rules for `  input_column  ` :

  - May access columns from the input table, as well as correlated columns, not columns defined by the `  PIVOT  ` clause, itself.
  - Evaluated against each row in the input table; aggregate and window function calls are prohibited.
  - Non-determinism is okay.
  - The type must be groupable.
  - The input table may be accessed through its alias if one is provided.

Rules for `  pivot_column  ` :

  - A `  pivot_column  ` must be a constant.
  - Named constants, such as variables, aren't supported.
  - Query parameters aren't supported.
  - If a name is desired for a named constant or query parameter, specify it explicitly with an alias.
  - Corner cases exist where a distinct `  pivot_column  ` s can end up with the same default column names. For example, an input column might contain both a `  NULL  ` value and the string literal `  "NULL"  ` . When this happens, multiple pivot columns are created with the same name. To avoid this situation, use aliases for pivot column names.
  - If a `  pivot_column  ` doesn't specify an alias, a column name is constructed as follows:

**Examples**

The following examples reference a table called `  Produce  ` that looks like this:

``` text
WITH Produce AS (
  SELECT 'Kale' as product, 51 as sales, 'Q1' as quarter, 2020 as year UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Kale', 23, 'Q2', 2020 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Kale', 45, 'Q3', 2020 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Kale', 3, 'Q4', 2020 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Kale', 70, 'Q1', 2021 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Kale', 85, 'Q2', 2021 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Apple', 77, 'Q1', 2020 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Apple', 0, 'Q2', 2020 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Apple', 1, 'Q1', 2021)
SELECT * FROM Produce

/*---------+-------+---------+------+
 | product | sales | quarter | year |
 +---------+-------+---------+------|
 | Kale    | 51    | Q1      | 2020 |
 | Kale    | 23    | Q2      | 2020 |
 | Kale    | 45    | Q3      | 2020 |
 | Kale    | 3     | Q4      | 2020 |
 | Kale    | 70    | Q1      | 2021 |
 | Kale    | 85    | Q2      | 2021 |
 | Apple   | 77    | Q1      | 2020 |
 | Apple   | 0     | Q2      | 2020 |
 | Apple   | 1     | Q1      | 2021 |
 +---------+-------+---------+------*/
```

With the `  PIVOT  ` operator, the rows in the `  quarter  ` column are rotated into these new columns: `  Q1  ` , `  Q2  ` , `  Q3  ` , `  Q4  ` . The aggregate function `  SUM  ` is implicitly grouped by all unaggregated columns other than the `  pivot_column  ` : `  product  ` and `  year  ` .

``` text
SELECT * FROM
  Produce
  PIVOT(SUM(sales) FOR quarter IN ('Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4'))

/*---------+------+----+------+------+------+
 | product | year | Q1 | Q2   | Q3   | Q4   |
 +---------+------+----+------+------+------+
 | Apple   | 2020 | 77 | 0    | NULL | NULL |
 | Apple   | 2021 | 1  | NULL | NULL | NULL |
 | Kale    | 2020 | 51 | 23   | 45   | 3    |
 | Kale    | 2021 | 70 | 85   | NULL | NULL |
 +---------+------+----+------+------+------*/
```

If you don't include `  year  ` , then `  SUM  ` is grouped only by `  product  ` .

``` text
SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT product, sales, quarter FROM Produce)
  PIVOT(SUM(sales) FOR quarter IN ('Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4'))

/*---------+-----+-----+------+------+
 | product | Q1  | Q2  | Q3   | Q4   |
 +---------+-----+-----+------+------+
 | Apple   | 78  | 0   | NULL | NULL |
 | Kale    | 121 | 108 | 45   | 3    |
 +---------+-----+-----+------+------*/
```

You can select a subset of values in the `  pivot_column  ` :

``` text
SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT product, sales, quarter FROM Produce)
  PIVOT(SUM(sales) FOR quarter IN ('Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3'))

/*---------+-----+-----+------+
 | product | Q1  | Q2  | Q3   |
 +---------+-----+-----+------+
 | Apple   | 78  | 0   | NULL |
 | Kale    | 121 | 108 | 45   |
 +---------+-----+-----+------*/
```

``` text
SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT sales, quarter FROM Produce)
  PIVOT(SUM(sales) FOR quarter IN ('Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3'))

/*-----+-----+----+
 | Q1  | Q2  | Q3 |
 +-----+-----+----+
 | 199 | 108 | 45 |
 +-----+-----+----*/
```

You can include multiple aggregation functions in the `  PIVOT  ` . In this case, you must specify an alias for each aggregation. These aliases are used to construct the column names in the resulting table.

``` text
SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT product, sales, quarter FROM Produce)
  PIVOT(SUM(sales) AS total_sales, COUNT(*) AS num_records FOR quarter IN ('Q1', 'Q2'))

/*--------+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
 |product | total_sales_Q1 | num_records_Q1 | total_sales_Q2 | num_records_Q2 |
 +--------+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
 | Kale   | 121            | 2              | 108            | 2              |
 | Apple  | 78             | 2              | 0              | 1              |
 +--------+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------*/
```

## `     UNPIVOT    ` operator

``` text
FROM from_item[, ...] unpivot_operator

unpivot_operator:
  UNPIVOT [ { INCLUDE NULLS | EXCLUDE NULLS } ] (
    { single_column_unpivot | multi_column_unpivot }
  ) [unpivot_alias]

single_column_unpivot:
  values_column
  FOR name_column
  IN (columns_to_unpivot)

multi_column_unpivot:
  values_column_set
  FOR name_column
  IN (column_sets_to_unpivot)

values_column_set:
  (values_column[, ...])

columns_to_unpivot:
  unpivot_column [row_value_alias][, ...]

column_sets_to_unpivot:
  (unpivot_column [row_value_alias][, ...])

unpivot_alias and row_value_alias:
  [AS] alias
```

The `  UNPIVOT  ` operator rotates columns into rows. `  UNPIVOT  ` is part of the `  FROM  ` clause.

  - `  UNPIVOT  ` can be used to modify any table expression.
  - Combining `  UNPIVOT  ` with `  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  ` isn't allowed, although users may use `  UNPIVOT  ` against a subquery input which itself uses `  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  ` .
  - A `  WITH OFFSET  ` clause immediately preceding the `  UNPIVOT  ` operator isn't allowed.
  - `  PIVOT  ` aggregations can't be reversed with `  UNPIVOT  ` .

Conceptual example:

``` text
-- Before UNPIVOT is used to rotate Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 into sales and quarter columns:
/*---------+----+----+----+----+
 | product | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
 +---------+----+----+----+----+
 | Kale    | 51 | 23 | 45 | 3  |
 | Apple   | 77 | 0  | 25 | 2  |
 +---------+----+----+----+----*/

-- After UNPIVOT is used to rotate Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 into sales and quarter columns:
/*---------+-------+---------+
 | product | sales | quarter |
 +---------+-------+---------+
 | Kale    | 51    | Q1      |
 | Kale    | 23    | Q2      |
 | Kale    | 45    | Q3      |
 | Kale    | 3     | Q4      |
 | Apple   | 77    | Q1      |
 | Apple   | 0     | Q2      |
 | Apple   | 25    | Q3      |
 | Apple   | 2     | Q4      |
 +---------+-------+---------*/
```

[Follow these rules](#rules_for_row_value_alias) when creating a row value alias.

**Rules**

Rules for a `  from_item  ` passed to `  UNPIVOT  ` :

  - The `  from_item  ` may consist of any table, subquery, or table-valued function (TVF) result.
  - The `  from_item  ` may not produce a value table.
  - Duplicate columns in a `  from_item  ` can't be referenced in the `  UNPIVOT  ` clause.

Rules for `  unpivot_operator  ` :

  - Expressions aren't permitted.
  - Qualified names aren't permitted. For example, `  mytable.mycolumn  ` isn't allowed.
  - In the case where the `  UNPIVOT  ` result has duplicate column names:
      - `  SELECT *  ` is allowed.
      - `  SELECT values_column  ` causes ambiguity.

Rules for `  values_column  ` :

  - It can't be a name used for a `  name_column  ` or an `  unpivot_column  ` .
  - It can be the same name as a column from the `  from_item  ` .

Rules for `  name_column  ` :

  - It can't be a name used for a `  values_column  ` or an `  unpivot_column  ` .
  - It can be the same name as a column from the `  from_item  ` .

Rules for `  unpivot_column  ` :

  - Must be a column name from the `  from_item  ` .
  - It can't reference duplicate `  from_item  ` column names.
  - All columns in a column set must have equivalent data types.
      - Data types can't be coerced to a common supertype.
      - If the data types are exact matches (for example, a struct with different field names), the data type of the first input is the data type of the output.
  - You can't have the same name in the same column set. For example, `  (emp1, emp1)  ` results in an error.
  - You can have a the same name in different column sets. For example, `  (emp1, emp2), (emp1, emp3)  ` is valid.

Rules for `  row_value_alias  ` :

  - This can be a string or an `  INT64  ` literal.
  - The data type for all `  row_value_alias  ` clauses must be the same.
  - If the value is an `  INT64  ` , the `  row_value_alias  ` for each `  unpivot_column  ` must be specified.

**Examples**

The following examples reference a table called `  Produce  ` that looks like this:

``` text
WITH Produce AS (
  SELECT 'Kale' as product, 51 as Q1, 23 as Q2, 45 as Q3, 3 as Q4 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Apple', 77, 0, 25, 2)
SELECT * FROM Produce

/*---------+----+----+----+----+
 | product | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
 +---------+----+----+----+----+
 | Kale    | 51 | 23 | 45 | 3  |
 | Apple   | 77 | 0  | 25 | 2  |
 +---------+----+----+----+----*/
```

With the `  UNPIVOT  ` operator, the columns `  Q1  ` , `  Q2  ` , `  Q3  ` , and `  Q4  ` are rotated. The values of these columns now populate a new column called `  Sales  ` and the names of these columns now populate a new column called `  Quarter  ` . This is a single-column unpivot operation.

``` text
SELECT * FROM Produce
UNPIVOT(sales FOR quarter IN (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4))

/*---------+-------+---------+
 | product | sales | quarter |
 +---------+-------+---------+
 | Kale    | 51    | Q1      |
 | Kale    | 23    | Q2      |
 | Kale    | 45    | Q3      |
 | Kale    | 3     | Q4      |
 | Apple   | 77    | Q1      |
 | Apple   | 0     | Q2      |
 | Apple   | 25    | Q3      |
 | Apple   | 2     | Q4      |
 +---------+-------+---------*/
```

In this example, we `  UNPIVOT  ` four quarters into two semesters. This is a multi-column unpivot operation.

``` text
SELECT * FROM Produce
UNPIVOT(
  (first_half_sales, second_half_sales)
  FOR semesters
  IN ((Q1, Q2) AS 'semester_1', (Q3, Q4) AS 'semester_2'))

/*---------+------------------+-------------------+------------+
 | product | first_half_sales | second_half_sales | semesters  |
 +---------+------------------+-------------------+------------+
 | Kale    | 51               | 23                | semester_1 |
 | Kale    | 45               | 3                 | semester_2 |
 | Apple   | 77               | 0                 | semester_1 |
 | Apple   | 25               | 2                 | semester_2 |

## `     TABLESAMPLE    ` operator

``` text
TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM ( percent PERCENT )
```

**Description**

You can use the `  TABLESAMPLE  ` operator to select a random sample of a dataset. This operator is useful when you're working with tables that have large amounts of data and you don't need precise answers.

Sampling returns a variety of records while avoiding the costs associated with scanning and processing an entire table. Each execution of the query might return different results because each execution processes an independently computed sample. GoogleSQL doesn't cache the results of queries that include a `  TABLESAMPLE  ` clause.

Replace `  percent  ` with the percentage of the dataset that you want to include in the results. The value must be between `  0  ` and `  100  ` . The value can be a literal value or a query parameter. It can't be a variable.

For more information, see [Table sampling](/bigquery/docs/table-sampling) .

**Example**

The following query selects approximately 10% of a table's data:

``` text
SELECT * FROM dataset.my_table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (10 PERCENT)
```

## `     MATCH_RECOGNIZE    ` clause

``` text
FROM from_item
MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expr [, ... ] ]
  ORDER BY order_expr [{ ASC | DESC }] [{ NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST }] [, ...]
  MEASURES { measures_expr [AS] alias } [, ... ]
  [ AFTER MATCH SKIP { PAST LAST ROW | TO NEXT ROW } ]
  PATTERN (pattern)
  DEFINE symbol AS boolean_expr [, ... ]
  [ OPTIONS ( [ use_longest_match = { TRUE | FALSE } ] ) ]
)
```

**Description**

The `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause is an optional sub-clause of the `  FROM  ` clause, used to filter and aggregate based on matches. A *match* is an ordered sequence of rows that match a pattern that you specify. Matching rows works similarly to matching with regular expressions, but instead of matching characters in a string, the `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause finds matches across rows in a table.

**Definitions**

  - `  from_item  ` : The data over which the `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause operates.
  - `  partition_expr  ` : An expression for how to partition the input. The expression can't contain floating point types, non-groupable types, constants, or window functions.
  - `  order_expr  ` : An orderable column or expression used to order the rows before matching.
  - `  measures_expr  ` : An aggregate expression that is evaluated per partition and match. The expression can reference columns and symbols.
  - `  alias  ` : The output column name for `  measures_expr  ` .
  - `  PAST LAST ROW  ` : Don't allow overlapping matches. The next match must start from one or more rows past the last row in the previous match. The default value for `  AFTER MATCH SKIP  ` is `  PAST LAST ROW  ` .
  - `  TO NEXT ROW  ` : Allow overlapping matches. The next match can begin one row after the start of the previous match. Multiple matches that start at the same row aren't allowed.
  - `  pattern  ` : A sequence of symbols and [pattern elements](#match_recognize_pattern) that defines a match.
  - `  symbol  ` : A name given to a boolean expression used to construct the pattern.
  - `  boolean_expr  ` : A boolean expression for a symbol that determines whether a row matches that symbol.
  - `  use_longest_match  ` : If true, then the chosen match starting from any given row is the match that includes the most rows. The default value is `  FALSE  ` . For more information, see [Match disambiguation rules](#match_disambiguation) .

**Output**

When you use the `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause, input data is transformed in the following way:

If the `  PARTITION BY  ` clause is present, then the output is the following:

  - There is one row for each match in each partition. Partitions with no matches don't generate any rows.
  - There is one column for each expression in the `  PARTITION BY  ` clause, and one column for each expression in the `  MEASURES  ` clause.

If the `  PARTITION BY  ` clause is omitted, then the output is the following:

  - There is one row for each match.
  - There is one column for each expression in the `  MEASURES  ` clause.

### `     PARTITION BY    ` clause

The `  PARTITION BY  ` clause specifies a list of expressions that are used to partition the input rows for pattern matching. Each partition is sorted according to the `  ORDER BY  ` clause and matches must be entirely contained within a partition. If the `  PARTITION BY  ` clause is omitted, then the entire input table belongs to a single partition.

You can't introduce an alias for a partition expression. If the expression is a single column name, then that name is used as the column name in the output. Otherwise, the output column for that partition is anonymous.

### `     ORDER BY    ` clause

The `  ORDER BY  ` clause within a `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause orders the rows of the input for pattern matching and follows the same rules as the standard [`  ORDER BY  ` clause](#order_by_clause) . The data type of each expression must be [orderable](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#orderable_data_types) . If all expressions in the `  ORDER BY  ` clause are tied, then the rows may be ordered arbitrarily.

### `     MEASURES    ` clause

The `  MEASURES  ` clause lists which aggregate expressions to compute for each match, subject to the following rules:

  - You must provide an alias for each aggregate expression.
  - Aggregate expressions must aggregate any columns that they reference, except for columns in the `  PARTITION BY  ` clause, which are guaranteed to have the same value for every row in a match.
  - To perform aggregation only on rows that matched a particular symbol, use the syntax `  symbol_name.column_name  ` . You can't use a symbol without a column reference. You can't reference multiple symbols within the same aggregation function.
  - A single row can match at most one symbol within a pattern. If a row satisfies the boolean expressions of multiple symbols in the `  DEFINE  ` clause, only the symbol that that takes precedence can contribute to an aggregation expression. For more information about how to determine which symbol counts towards a match, see [match disambiguation](#match_disambiguation) .

#### Order-sensitive aggregate functions

If an aggregate expression contains a function that depends on the order of input, such as `  ARRAY_AGG  ` or `  STRING_AGG  ` , the inputs are ordered according to the `  ORDER BY  ` clause of the `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause, unless they include the keyword `  DISTINCT  ` or an explicit ordering. If you explicitly specify an ordering within an aggregate function call, such as `  ARRAY_AGG(x ORDER BY x)  ` , then the function uses the order that you specified.

#### `     MEASURES    ` clause functions

In addition to the standard aggregate functions, you can use the following functions in the `  MEASURES  ` clause:

  - `  FIRST(x)  ` : Returns the value of `  x  ` in the first row of the match, or `  NULL  ` if the match is empty.
  - `  LAST(x)  ` : Returns the value of `  x  ` in the last row of the match, or `  NULL  ` if the match is empty.
  - `  MATCH_NUMBER()  ` : Returns the integer rank of the match, relative to other matches in the same partition, starting at 1. Matches are ranked according to the order of their starting rows using the `  ORDER BY  ` clause. This function can be used with or without aggregation, because it returns the same value for every row in a match.
  - `  MATCH_ROW_NUMBER()  ` : Returns an integer specifying the row number of the current row, within the current match, starting at 1. The results of this function must be aggregated.
  - `  CLASSIFIER()  ` : Returns a `  STRING  ` value for each row in the match that indicates the name of the symbol matched by the row. The results of this function must be aggregated.

The following SQL snippet references a table with columns called `  sales  ` , `  sale_date  ` , and `  customer  ` , and shows examples of what is and isn't allowed in the `  MEASURES  ` clause:

``` text
PARTITION BY customer
ORDER BY sale_date
MEASURES
  # Error. No alias.
  SUM(sales),

  # Correct. You don't need to aggregate a partition column.
  customer AS customer_name,

  # Error. You must aggregate all non-partition columns.
  sales AS customer_sales,

  # Correct. You can aggregate table columns.
  SUM(sales) AS total_sales,

  # Correct. Uses the symbol.column syntax.
  SUM(low_sales.sales) AS total_low_sales,

  # Correct. Multiple symbols appear in separate aggregations.
  SUM(low_sales.sales) + SUM(high_sales.sales) AS combined_low_high,

  # Error. Multiple symbols appear in a single aggregation.
  SUM(low_sales.sales + high_sales.sales) AS bad_combined_sales,

  # Error. A single aggregation can't combine symbol-qualified and
  # non-symbol-qualified terms.
  SUM(low_sales.sales + sales)
PATTERN (low_sales+ high_sales*)
DEFINE
  low_sales AS sales < 100,
  high_sales AS sales > 200
```

### `     PATTERN    ` clause

The `  PATTERN  ` clause specifies a pattern to match. A pattern is a sequence of symbols and operators. Adjacent symbols within a pattern must be separated by a space or grouped separately using parentheses. Pattern matches are computed based on the order specified in the `  ORDER BY  ` clause. Each pattern match must appear entirely within a partition. Patterns support the following elements, listed in order of precedence:

</table>

The values of `  m  ` and `  n  ` must be non-null integer literals or query parameters between 0 and 10,000. If a quantifier contains an upper and lower bound, such as `  {m,n}  ` , then the upper bound can't be less than the lower bound.

### `     DEFINE    ` clause

The `  DEFINE  ` clause lists all symbols used in the pattern. Each symbol is defined by a boolean expression. The symbol can match a row if the expression evaluates to `  TRUE  ` for that row. Every symbol must appear at least once in the `  PATTERN  ` clause.

A single row can match at most one symbol within a match, even if it satisfies the boolean expressions of multiple symbols in the `  DEFINE  ` clause. Multiple matches can't start at the same row. For more information, see [match disambiguation](#match_disambiguation) .

For example, you can use the following pattern and symbols in a `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause to match pairs of adjacent rows in which the value of `  sales  ` is less than 100 in the first row and greater than 200 in the following row:

``` text
PATTERN (low_sales high_sales)
DEFINE
  low_sales AS sales < 100,
  high_sales AS sales > 200
```

The following example matches one or more rows with sales less than 100, followed by at most one row with sales greater than 200, followed by any number of rows with sales less than 100:

``` text
PATTERN (low_sales+ high_sales? low_sales*)
DEFINE
  low_sales AS sales < 100,
  high_sales AS sales > 200
```

There are two functions unique to the `  DEFINE  ` clause, `  PREV()  ` and `  NEXT()  ` , that you can use to define a symbol in relation to rows around the current row. Each function accepts a column name and, optionally, a nonnegative integer indicating how many rows away to look:

  - `  PREV(column_name [, num_rows])  ` : Returns the value of `  column_name  ` that occurs `  num_rows  ` before the current row, or `  NULL  ` if that row doesn't exist. The default value of `  num_rows  ` is 1.
  - `  NEXT(column_name [, num_rows])  ` : Returns the value of `  column_name  ` that occurs `  num_rows  ` after the current row, or `  NULL  ` if that row doesn't exist. The default value of `  num_rows  ` is 1.

You can't use navigation functions, such as `  LEAD  ` or `  LAG  ` , to reference other row values.

The following example matches sequences of three rows in which the value of `  x  ` increases and then decreases:

``` text
PATTERN (incline peak decline)
DEFINE
  incline AS x < NEXT(x),
  peak AS PREV(x) < x AND x > NEXT(x),
  decline AS PREV(x) > x
```

### Match disambiguation

When multiple matches exist with the same starting row, only one is selected according to the following rules:

1.  Longest match mode.
    
      - If the `  OPTIONS  ` clause is present and `  use_longest_match  ` is `  TRUE  ` , then the chosen match is the one that includes the most rows. In case of a tie, the chosen match is decided by operator preference.
      - If the `  OPTIONS  ` clause is not present or `  use_longest_match  ` is `  FALSE  ` , then the match is chosen based on operator preference.

2.  Operator preference.
    
      - The `  |  ` operator gives preference to the left operand over the right operand.
      - Greedy quantifiers, which include `  ?  ` , `  *  ` , `  +  ` , `  {m,}  ` , `  {,n}  ` , and `  {m,n}  ` , give preference to matches that repeat the operand more times over matches that repeat it fewer times.
      - Reluctant quantifiers, which include `  ??  ` , `  *?  ` , `  {m,}?  ` , `  {,n}?  ` , and `  {m,n}?  ` , give preference to matches that repeat the operand fewer times over matches that repeat it more times.

When operator preferences in different parts of the pattern conflict with each other, preferences that occur earlier in the match take priority over those that occur later in the match. For example, the pattern `  A* B+  ` first prioritizes increasing the number of rows that match the `  A  ` symbol, even if that results in fewer rows that match the `  B  ` symbol. In other words, `  AAB  ` is chosen over `  ABB  ` .

The pattern `  (A|B B)+  ` prioritizes starting the match with `  AB  ` rather than `  BB  ` , even if that results in fewer repetitions overall.

**Examples**

In the following example, pattern matches are single rows. The pattern matches the `  low  ` symbol if `  x  ` is less than or equal to 2. The pattern matches the `  high  ` symbol if `  x  ` is greater than or equal to 2. There are three matches, one for each row:

  - The first row of input only satisfies the `  low  ` symbol expression, so `  x = 1  ` contributes to the `  low_agg  ` aggregation but not the `  high_agg  ` aggregation.
  - In the second row of input, `  x  ` satisfies both symbol expressions, but the `  low  ` symbol takes precedence because in the `  |  ` operator, preference is given to the symbol on the left. Therefore, `  x = 2  ` contributes only to the `  low_agg  ` aggregation.
  - The third row of input only satisfies the `  high  ` symbol expression, so `  x = 3  ` contributes to the `  high_agg  ` aggregation but not the `  low_agg  ` aggregation.

<!-- end list -->

``` text
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT 1 as x
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3
)
MATCH_RECOGNIZE(
  ORDER BY x
  MEASURES
    ARRAY_AGG(high.x) AS high_agg,
    ARRAY_AGG(low.x) AS low_agg
  AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW
  PATTERN (low | high)
  DEFINE
    low AS x <= 2,
    high AS x >= 2
);

/*----------+---------+
 | high_agg | low_agg |

 | NULL     | [1]     |
 | NULL     | [2]     |
 | [3]      | NULL    |
 +----------+---------*/
```

The following example is similar to the preceding example, except that the pattern is changed to `  low | high+  ` and the `  use_longest_match  ` option is set to `  TRUE  ` . There are three potential pattern matches that start at the second row of input:

1.  Match the second row using the `  low  ` symbol.
2.  Match the second row using the `  high  ` symbol.
3.  Match the second row using the `  high  ` symbol and the third row using the `  high  ` symbol.

The third option is chosen because it's strictly longest. Since there is no tie for length, operator preference isn't considered.

  SELECT 1 as x

    ARRAY_AGG(low.x) AS low_agg
  AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW

  DEFINE
    low AS x <= 2,
    high AS x >= 2
  OPTIONS (use_longest_match = TRUE)
);

/*----------+---------+

The following example, like the previous example, matches electronics purchases that were eventually followed by software purchases.

The following example matches a sequence of rows where `  amount  ` is less than 50, followed by rows where `  amount  ` is between 50 and 100, followed by rows where `  amount  ` is greater than 100. The query uses the `  MATCH_NUMBER  ` , `  MATCH_ROW_NUMBER  ` , and `  CLASSIFIER  ` functions in the `  MEASURES  ` clause to identify matches and their symbols in the results.

### Best practices

To scale the performance of queries that contain the `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause, use the following best practices:

  - Use the `  PARTITION BY  ` clause.
      - Within each partition, rows are processed one at a time. Separate partitions can be processed in parallel, subject to slot availability.
      - The `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause generally runs faster when you use a larger number of smaller partitions, rather than fewer large partitions.
      - Individual partitions which are too large, typically exceeding 1 million rows, might cause an [`  Out of memory  ` error](/bigquery/docs/troubleshoot-queries#query_not_executed) .
  - Use simple patterns.
      - Avoid patterns with a large number of operators.
      - Avoid bounded quantifiers with large bound values. For example, matching the patterns `  A+  ` or `  A*  ` is faster than matching `  A{,100}  ` .
  - Use the `  ORDER BY  ` clause to guarantee the order in which the input rows are processed. Otherwise the `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause can produce non-deterministic results.

For more example queries, see the [`  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` notebook tutorial](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-utils/blob/master/notebooks/bigquery_match_recognize_demo.ipynb) .

## Join operation

``` text
join_operation:
  { cross_join_operation | condition_join_operation }

cross_join_operation:
  from_item cross_join_operator from_item

condition_join_operation:
  from_item condition_join_operator from_item join_condition

cross_join_operator:
  { CROSS JOIN | , }

condition_join_operator:
  {
    [INNER] JOIN
    | FULL [OUTER] JOIN
    | LEFT [OUTER] JOIN
    | RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN
  }

join_condition:
  { on_clause | using_clause }

on_clause:
  ON bool_expression

using_clause:
  USING ( column_list )
```

The `  JOIN  ` operation merges two `  from_item  ` s so that the `  SELECT  ` clause can query them as one source. The join operator and join condition specify how to combine and discard rows from the two `  from_item  ` s to form a single source.

### `     [INNER] JOIN    `

An `  INNER JOIN  ` , or simply `  JOIN  ` , effectively calculates the Cartesian product of the two `  from_item  ` s and discards all rows that don't meet the join condition. *Effectively* means that it's possible to implement an `  INNER JOIN  ` without actually calculating the Cartesian product.

``` text
FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.w = B.y

/*
Table A       Table B       Result
+-------+     +-------+     +---------------+
| w | x |  *  | y | z |  =  | w | x | y | z |
+-------+     +-------+     +---------------+
| 1 | a |     | 2 | k |     | 2 | b | 2 | k |
| 2 | b |     | 3 | m |     | 3 | c | 3 | m |
| 3 | c |     | 3 | n |     | 3 | c | 3 | n |
| 3 | d |     | 4 | p |     | 3 | d | 3 | m |
+-------+     +-------+     | 3 | d | 3 | n |
                            +---------------+
*/
```

``` text
FROM A INNER JOIN B USING (x)

/*
Table A       Table B       Result
+-------+     +-------+     +-----------+
| x | y |  *  | x | z |  =  | x | y | z |
+-------+     +-------+     +-----------+

| 3 | c |     | 3 | n |     | 3 | c | n |
| 3 | d |     | 4 | p |     | 3 | d | m |
+-------+     +-------+     | 3 | d | n |
                            +-----------+
*/
```

**Example**

This query performs an `  INNER JOIN  ` on the [`  Roster  `](#roster_table) and [`  TeamMascot  `](#teammascot_table) tables.

``` text
SELECT Roster.LastName, TeamMascot.Mascot
FROM Roster JOIN TeamMascot ON Roster.SchoolID = TeamMascot.SchoolID;

/*---------------------------+
 | LastName   | Mascot       |
 +---------------------------+
 | Adams      | Jaguars      |
 | Buchanan   | Lakers       |
 | Coolidge   | Lakers       |
 | Davis      | Knights      |
 +---------------------------*/
```

You can use a [correlated](#correlated_join) `  INNER JOIN  ` to flatten an array into a set of rows. To learn more, see [Convert elements in an array to rows in a table](/bigquery/docs/arrays#flattening_arrays) .

### `     CROSS JOIN    `

`  CROSS JOIN  ` returns the Cartesian product of the two `  from_item  ` s. In other words, it combines each row from the first `  from_item  ` with each row from the second `  from_item  ` .

If the rows of the two `  from_item  ` s are independent, then the result has *M \* N* rows, given *M* rows in one `  from_item  ` and *N* in the other. Note that this still holds for the case when either `  from_item  ` has zero rows.

In a `  FROM  ` clause, a `  CROSS JOIN  ` can be written like this:

``` text
FROM A CROSS JOIN B

/*
Table A       Table B       Result
+-------+     +-------+     +---------------+
| w | x |  *  | y | z |  =  | w | x | y | z |
+-------+     +-------+     +---------------+
| 1 | a |     | 2 | c |     | 1 | a | 2 | c |
| 2 | b |     | 3 | d |     | 1 | a | 3 | d |
+-------+     +-------+     | 2 | b | 2 | c |
                            | 2 | b | 3 | d |
                            +---------------+
*/
```

You can use a [correlated](#correlated_join) cross join to convert or flatten an array into a set of rows, though the (equivalent) `  INNER JOIN  ` is preferred over `  CROSS JOIN  ` for this case. To learn more, see [Convert elements in an array to rows in a table](/bigquery/docs/arrays#flattening_arrays) .

**Examples**

This query performs an `  CROSS JOIN  ` on the [`  Roster  `](#roster_table) and [`  TeamMascot  `](#teammascot_table) tables.

``` text
SELECT Roster.LastName, TeamMascot.Mascot
FROM Roster CROSS JOIN TeamMascot;

/*---------------------------+
 | LastName   | Mascot       |
 +---------------------------+
 | Adams      | Jaguars      |
 | Adams      | Knights      |
 | Adams      | Lakers       |
 | Adams      | Mustangs     |
 | Buchanan   | Jaguars      |
 | Buchanan   | Knights      |
 | Buchanan   | Lakers       |
 | Buchanan   | Mustangs     |
 | ...                       |
 +---------------------------*/
```

### Comma cross join (,)

[`  CROSS JOIN  `](#cross_join) s can be written implicitly with a comma. This is called a comma cross join.

A comma cross join looks like this in a `  FROM  ` clause:

``` text
FROM A, B

/*
Table A       Table B       Result
+-------+     +-------+     +---------------+
| w | x |  *  | y | z |  =  | w | x | y | z |
+-------+     +-------+     +---------------+
| 1 | a |     | 2 | c |     | 1 | a | 2 | c |
| 2 | b |     | 3 | d |     | 1 | a | 3 | d |
+-------+     +-------+     | 2 | b | 2 | c |
                            | 2 | b | 3 | d |
                            +---------------+
*/
```

You can't write comma cross joins inside parentheses. To learn more, see [Join operations in a sequence](#sequences_of_joins) .

``` text
FROM (A, B)  // INVALID
```

You can use a [correlated](#correlated_join) comma cross join to convert or flatten an array into a set of rows. To learn more, see [Convert elements in an array to rows in a table](/bigquery/docs/arrays#flattening_arrays) .

**Examples**

This query performs a comma cross join on the [`  Roster  `](#roster_table) and [`  TeamMascot  `](#teammascot_table) tables.

``` text
SELECT Roster.LastName, TeamMascot.Mascot
FROM Roster, TeamMascot;

/*---------------------------+
 | LastName   | Mascot       |
 +---------------------------+
 | Adams      | Jaguars      |
 | Adams      | Knights      |
 | Adams      | Lakers       |
 | Adams      | Mustangs     |
 | Buchanan   | Jaguars      |
 | Buchanan   | Knights      |
 | Buchanan   | Lakers       |
 | Buchanan   | Mustangs     |
 | ...                       |
 +---------------------------*/
```

### `     FULL [OUTER] JOIN    `

A `  FULL OUTER JOIN  ` (or simply `  FULL JOIN  ` ) returns all fields for all matching rows in both `  from_items  ` that meet the join condition. If a given row from one `  from_item  ` doesn't join to any row in the other `  from_item  ` , the row returns with `  NULL  ` values for all columns from the other `  from_item  ` .

``` text
FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON A.w = B.y

/*
Table A       Table B       Result
+-------+     +-------+     +---------------------------+
| w | x |  *  | y | z |  =  | w    | x    | y    | z    |
+-------+     +-------+     +---------------------------+
| 1 | a |     | 2 | k |     | 1    | a    | NULL | NULL |

                            +---------------------------+
*/
```

``` text
FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B USING (x)

/*
Table A       Table B       Result
+-------+     +-------+     +--------------------+

                            +--------------------+
*/
```

**Example**

This query performs a `  FULL JOIN  ` on the [`  Roster  `](#roster_table) and [`  TeamMascot  `](#teammascot_table) tables.

``` text
SELECT Roster.LastName, TeamMascot.Mascot
FROM Roster FULL JOIN TeamMascot ON Roster.SchoolID = TeamMascot.SchoolID;

 | NULL       | Mustangs     |
 +---------------------------*/
```

### `     LEFT [OUTER] JOIN    `

The result of a `  LEFT OUTER JOIN  ` (or simply `  LEFT JOIN  ` ) for two `  from_item  ` s always retains all rows of the left `  from_item  ` in the `  JOIN  ` operation, even if no rows in the right `  from_item  ` satisfy the join predicate.

All rows from the *left* `  from_item  ` are retained; if a given row from the left `  from_item  ` doesn't join to any row in the *right* `  from_item  ` , the row will return with `  NULL  ` values for all columns exclusively from the right `  from_item  ` . Rows from the right `  from_item  ` that don't join to any row in the left `  from_item  ` are discarded.

``` text
FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.w = B.y

### `     RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN    `

The result of a `  RIGHT OUTER JOIN  ` (or simply `  RIGHT JOIN  ` ) for two `  from_item  ` s always retains all rows of the right `  from_item  ` in the `  JOIN  ` operation, even if no rows in the left `  from_item  ` satisfy the join predicate.

All rows from the *right* `  from_item  ` are returned; if a given row from the right `  from_item  ` doesn't join to any row in the *left* `  from_item  ` , the row will return with `  NULL  ` values for all columns exclusively from the left `  from_item  ` . Rows from the left `  from_item  ` that don't join to any row in the right `  from_item  ` are discarded.

### Join conditions

In a [join operation](#join_types) , a join condition helps specify how to combine rows in two `  from_items  ` to form a single source.

The two types of join conditions are the [`  ON  ` clause](#on_clause) and [`  USING  ` clause](#using_clause) . You must use a join condition when you perform a conditional join operation. You can't use a join condition when you perform a cross join operation.

#### `     ON    ` clause

``` text
ON bool_expression
```

**Description**

Given a row from each table, if the `  ON  ` clause evaluates to `  TRUE  ` , the query generates a consolidated row with the result of combining the given rows.

Definitions:

  - `  bool_expression  ` : The boolean expression that specifies the condition for the join. This is frequently a [comparison operation](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#comparison_operators) or logical combination of comparison operators.

Details:

Similarly to `  CROSS JOIN  ` , `  ON  ` produces a column once for each column in each input table.

A `  NULL  ` join condition evaluation is equivalent to a `  FALSE  ` evaluation.

If a column-order sensitive operation such as `  UNION  ` or `  SELECT *  ` is used with the `  ON  ` join condition, the resulting table contains all of the columns from the left input in order, and then all of the columns from the right input in order.

**Examples**

The following examples show how to use the `  ON  ` clause:

``` text
WITH
  A AS ( SELECT 1 as x UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3),
  B AS ( SELECT 2 as x UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4)
SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.x = B.x;

WITH
  A AS ( SELECT 1 as x UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3),
  B AS ( SELECT 2 as x UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4)
SELECT A.x, B.x FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.x = B.x;

/*
Table A   Table B   Result (A.x, B.x)
+---+     +---+     +-------+
| x |  *  | x |  =  | x | x |
+---+     +---+     +-------+
| 1 |     | 2 |     | 2 | 2 |
| 2 |     | 3 |     | 3 | 3 |
| 3 |     | 4 |     +-------+
+---+     +---+
*/
```

``` text
WITH
  A AS ( SELECT 1 as x UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT NULL),
  B AS ( SELECT 2 as x UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5)
SELECT * FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.x = B.x;

WITH
  A AS ( SELECT 1 as x UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT NULL),
  B AS ( SELECT 2 as x UNION ALL SELECT 3 UNION ALL SELECT 4 UNION ALL SELECT 5)
SELECT A.x, B.x FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.x = B.x;

/*

*/
```

#### `     USING    ` clause

``` text
USING ( column_name_list )

column_name_list:
    column_name[, ...]
```

**Description**

When you are joining two tables, `  USING  ` performs an [equality comparison operation](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/operators#comparison_operators) on the columns named in `  column_name_list  ` . Each column name in `  column_name_list  ` must appear in both input tables. For each pair of rows from the input tables, if the equality comparisons all evaluate to `  TRUE  ` , one row is added to the resulting column.

Definitions:

  - `  column_name_list  ` : A list of columns to include in the join condition.
  - `  column_name  ` : The column that exists in both of the tables that you are joining.

Details:

A `  NULL  ` join condition evaluation is equivalent to a `  FALSE  ` evaluation.

If a column-order sensitive operation such as `  UNION  ` or `  SELECT *  ` is used with the `  USING  ` join condition, the resulting table contains columns in this order:

  - The columns from `  column_name_list  ` in the order they appear in the `  USING  ` clause.
  - All other columns of the left input in the order they appear in the input.
  - All other columns of the right input in the order they appear in the input.

A column name in the `  USING  ` clause must not be qualified by a table name.

If the join is an `  INNER JOIN  ` or a `  LEFT OUTER JOIN  ` , the output columns are populated from the values in the first table. If the join is a `  RIGHT OUTER JOIN  ` , the output columns are populated from the values in the second table. If the join is a `  FULL OUTER JOIN  ` , the output columns are populated by [coalescing](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conditional_expressions#coalesce) the values from the left and right tables in that order.

**Examples**

The following example shows how to use the `  USING  ` clause with one column name in the column name list:

``` text
WITH
  A AS ( SELECT 1 as x UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT NULL),
  B AS ( SELECT 2 as x UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 5)
SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B USING (x);

/*
Table A    Table B   Result
+------+   +---+     +---+
| x    | * | x |  =  | x |
+------+   +---+     +---+
| 1    |   | 2 |     | 2 |
| 2    |   | 9 |     | 9 |
| 9    |   | 9 |     | 9 |
| NULL |   | 5 |     +---+
+------+   +---+
*/
```

The following example shows how to use the `  USING  ` clause with multiple column names in the column name list:

``` text
WITH
  A AS (
    SELECT 1 as x, 15 as y UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 10 UNION ALL
    SELECT 9, 16 UNION ALL
    SELECT NULL, 12),
  B AS (
    SELECT 2 as x, 10 as y UNION ALL
    SELECT 9, 17 UNION ALL
    SELECT 9, 16 UNION ALL
    SELECT 5, 15)
SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B USING (x, y);

/*
Table A         Table B        Result
+-----------+   +---------+     +---------+
| x    | y  | * | x  | y  |  =  | x  | y  |
+-----------+   +---------+     +---------+
| 1    | 15 |   | 2  | 10 |     | 2  | 10 |
| 2    | 10 |   | 9  | 17 |     | 9  | 16 |
| 9    | 16 |   | 9  | 16 |     +---------+
| NULL | 12 |   | 5  | 15 |
+-----------+   +---------+
*/
```

The following examples show additional ways in which to use the `  USING  ` clause with one column name in the column name list:

``` text
WITH
  A AS ( SELECT 1 as x UNION ALL SELECT 2 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT NULL),
  B AS ( SELECT 2 as x UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 9 UNION ALL SELECT 5)

The following example shows how to use the `  USING  ` clause with only some column names in the column name list.

``` text
WITH

  B AS (
    SELECT 2 as x, 10 as y UNION ALL
    SELECT 9, 17 UNION ALL
    SELECT 9, 16 UNION ALL
    SELECT 5, 15)
SELECT * FROM A INNER JOIN B USING (x);

/*

```

The following query performs an `  INNER JOIN  ` on the [`  Roster  `](#roster_table) and [`  TeamMascot  `](#teammascot_table) table. The query returns the rows from `  Roster  ` and `  TeamMascot  ` where `  Roster.SchoolID  ` is the same as `  TeamMascot.SchoolID  ` . The results include a single `  SchoolID  ` column.

#### `     ON    ` and `     USING    ` equivalency

The [`  ON  `](#on_clause) and [`  USING  `](#using_clause) join conditions aren't equivalent, but they share some rules and sometimes they can produce similar results.

In the following examples, observe what is returned when all rows are produced for inner and outer joins. Also, look at how each join condition handles `  NULL  ` values.

Although `  ON  ` and `  USING  ` aren't equivalent, they can return the same results in some situations if you specify the columns you want to return.

In the following examples, observe what is returned when a specific row is produced for inner and outer joins. Also, look at how each join condition handles `  NULL  ` values.

### Join operations in a sequence

The `  FROM  ` clause can contain multiple `  JOIN  ` operations in a sequence. `  JOIN  ` s are bound from left to right. For example:

``` text
FROM A JOIN B USING (x) JOIN C USING (x)

-- A JOIN B USING (x)        = result_1
-- result_1 JOIN C USING (x) = result_2
-- result_2                  = return value
```

You can also insert parentheses to group `  JOIN  ` s:

``` text
FROM ( (A JOIN B USING (x)) JOIN C USING (x) )

-- A JOIN B USING (x)        = result_1
-- result_1 JOIN C USING (x) = result_2
-- result_2                  = return value
```

With parentheses, you can group `  JOIN  ` s so that they are bound in a different order:

``` text
FROM ( A JOIN (B JOIN C USING (x)) USING (x) )

-- B JOIN C USING (x)       = result_1
-- A JOIN result_1          = result_2
-- result_2                 = return value
```

A `  FROM  ` clause can have multiple joins. Provided there are no comma cross joins in the `  FROM  ` clause, joins don't require parenthesis, though parenthesis can help readability:

``` text
FROM A JOIN B JOIN C JOIN D USING (w) ON B.x = C.y ON A.z = B.x
```

If your clause contains comma cross joins, you must use parentheses:

``` text
FROM A, B JOIN C JOIN D ON C.x = D.y ON B.z = C.x    // INVALID
```

``` text
FROM A, B JOIN (C JOIN D ON C.x = D.y) ON B.z = C.x  // VALID
```

When comma cross joins are present in a query with a sequence of JOINs, they group from left to right like other `  JOIN  ` types:

``` text
FROM A JOIN B USING (x) JOIN C USING (x), D

-- A JOIN B USING (x)        = result_1
-- result_1 JOIN C USING (x) = result_2
-- result_2 CROSS JOIN D     = return value
```

There can't be a `  RIGHT JOIN  ` or `  FULL JOIN  ` after a comma cross join unless it's parenthesized:

``` text
FROM A, B RIGHT JOIN C ON TRUE // INVALID
```

``` text
FROM A, B FULL JOIN C ON TRUE  // INVALID
```

``` text
FROM A, B JOIN C ON TRUE       // VALID
```

``` text
FROM A, (B RIGHT JOIN C ON TRUE) // VALID
```

``` text
FROM A, (B FULL JOIN C ON TRUE)  // VALID
```

### Correlated join operation

A join operation is *correlated* when the right `  from_item  ` contains a reference to at least one range variable or column name introduced by the left `  from_item  ` .

In a correlated join operation, rows from the right `  from_item  ` are determined by a row from the left `  from_item  ` . Consequently, `  RIGHT OUTER  ` and `  FULL OUTER  ` joins can't be correlated because right `  from_item  ` rows can't be determined in the case when there is no row from the left `  from_item  ` .

All correlated join operations must reference an array in the right `  from_item  ` .

This is a conceptual example of a correlated join operation that includes a [correlated subquery](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries#correlated_subquery_concepts) :

``` text
FROM A JOIN UNNEST(ARRAY(SELECT AS STRUCT * FROM B WHERE A.ID = B.ID)) AS C
```

  - Left `  from_item  ` : `  A  `
  - Right `  from_item  ` : `  UNNEST(...) AS C  `
  - A correlated subquery: `  (SELECT AS STRUCT * FROM B WHERE A.ID = B.ID)  `

This is another conceptual example of a correlated join operation. `  array_of_IDs  ` is part of the left `  from_item  ` but is referenced in the right `  from_item  ` .

``` text
FROM A JOIN UNNEST(A.array_of_IDs) AS C
```

The [`  UNNEST  ` operator](#unnest_operator) can be explicit or implicit. These are both allowed:

``` text
FROM A JOIN UNNEST(A.array_of_IDs) AS IDs
```

``` text
FROM A JOIN A.array_of_IDs AS IDs
```

In a correlated join operation, the right `  from_item  ` is re-evaluated against each distinct row from the left `  from_item  ` . In the following conceptual example, the correlated join operation first evaluates `  A  ` and `  B  ` , then `  A  ` and `  C  ` :

``` text
FROM
  A
  JOIN
  UNNEST(ARRAY(SELECT AS STRUCT * FROM B WHERE A.ID = B.ID)) AS C
  ON A.Name = C.Name
```

**Caveats**

  - In a correlated `  LEFT JOIN  ` , when the input table on the right side is empty for some row from the left side, it's as if no rows from the right side satisfied the join condition in a regular `  LEFT JOIN  ` . When there are no joining rows, a row with `  NULL  ` values for all columns on the right side is generated to join with the row from the left side.
  - In a correlated `  CROSS JOIN  ` , when the input table on the right side is empty for some row from the left side, it's as if no rows from the right side satisfied the join condition in a regular correlated `  INNER JOIN  ` . This means that the row is dropped from the results.

**Examples**

This is an example of a correlated join, using the [Roster](#roster_table) and [PlayerStats](#playerstats_table) tables:

``` text
SELECT *
FROM
  Roster
JOIN
  UNNEST(
    ARRAY(
      SELECT AS STRUCT *
      FROM PlayerStats
      WHERE PlayerStats.OpponentID = Roster.SchoolID
    )) AS PlayerMatches
  ON PlayerMatches.LastName = 'Buchanan'

/*------------+----------+----------+------------+--------------+
 | LastName   | SchoolID | LastName | OpponentID | PointsScored |
 +------------+----------+----------+------------+--------------+
 | Adams      | 50       | Buchanan | 50         | 13           |
 | Eisenhower | 77       | Buchanan | 77         | 0            |
 +------------+----------+----------+------------+--------------*/
```

A common pattern for a correlated `  LEFT JOIN  ` is to have an `  UNNEST  ` operation on the right side that references an array from some column introduced by input on the left side. For rows where that array is empty or `  NULL  ` , the `  UNNEST  ` operation produces no rows on the right input. In that case, a row with a `  NULL  ` entry in each column of the right input is created to join with the row from the left input. For example:

``` text
SELECT A.name, item, ARRAY_LENGTH(A.items) item_count_for_name
FROM
  UNNEST(
    [
      STRUCT(
        'first' AS name,
        [1, 2, 3, 4] AS items),
      STRUCT(
        'second' AS name,
        [] AS items)]) AS A
LEFT JOIN
  A.items AS item;

/*--------+------+---------------------+
 | name   | item | item_count_for_name |
 +--------+------+---------------------+
 | first  | 1    | 4                   |
 | first  | 2    | 4                   |
 | first  | 3    | 4                   |
 | first  | 4    | 4                   |
 | second | NULL | 0                   |
 +--------+------+---------------------*/
```

In the case of a correlated `  INNER JOIN  ` or `  CROSS JOIN  ` , when the input on the right side is empty for some row from the left side, the final row is dropped from the results. For example:

``` text
SELECT A.name, item
FROM
  UNNEST(
    [
      STRUCT(
        'first' AS name,
        [1, 2, 3, 4] AS items),
      STRUCT(
        'second' AS name,
        [] AS items)]) AS A
INNER JOIN
  A.items AS item;

/*-------+------+
 | name  | item |
 +-------+------+
 | first | 1    |
 | first | 2    |
 | first | 3    |
 | first | 4    |
 +-------+------*/
```

## `     WHERE    ` clause

``` text
WHERE bool_expression
```

The `  WHERE  ` clause filters the results of the `  FROM  ` clause.

Only rows whose `  bool_expression  ` evaluates to `  TRUE  ` are included. Rows whose `  bool_expression  ` evaluates to `  NULL  ` or `  FALSE  ` are discarded.

The evaluation of a query with a `  WHERE  ` clause is typically completed in this order:

  - `  FROM  `
  - `  WHERE  `
  - `  GROUP BY  ` and aggregation
  - `  HAVING  `
  - `  WINDOW  `
  - `  QUALIFY  `
  - `  DISTINCT  `
  - `  ORDER BY  `
  - `  LIMIT  `

Evaluation order doesn't always match syntax order.

The `  WHERE  ` clause only references columns available via the `  FROM  ` clause; it can't reference `  SELECT  ` list aliases.

**Examples**

This query returns returns all rows from the [`  Roster  `](#roster_table) table where the `  SchoolID  ` column has the value `  52  ` :

``` text
SELECT * FROM Roster
WHERE SchoolID = 52;
```

The `  bool_expression  ` can contain multiple sub-conditions:

``` text
SELECT * FROM Roster
WHERE STARTS_WITH(LastName, "Mc") OR STARTS_WITH(LastName, "Mac");
```

Expressions in an `  INNER JOIN  ` have an equivalent expression in the `  WHERE  ` clause. For example, a query using `  INNER  ` `  JOIN  ` and `  ON  ` has an equivalent expression using `  CROSS JOIN  ` and `  WHERE  ` . For example, the following two queries are equivalent:

``` text
SELECT Roster.LastName, TeamMascot.Mascot
FROM Roster INNER JOIN TeamMascot
ON Roster.SchoolID = TeamMascot.SchoolID;
```

``` text
SELECT Roster.LastName, TeamMascot.Mascot
FROM Roster CROSS JOIN TeamMascot
WHERE Roster.SchoolID = TeamMascot.SchoolID;
```

## `     GROUP BY    ` clause

``` text
GROUP BY group_by_specification

group_by_specification:
  {
    groupable_items
    | ALL
    | grouping_sets_specification
    | rollup_specification
    | cube_specification
    | ()
  }
```

**Description**

The `  GROUP BY  ` clause groups together rows in a table that share common values for certain columns. For a group of rows in the source table with non-distinct values, the `  GROUP BY  ` clause aggregates them into a single combined row. This clause is commonly used when aggregate functions are present in the `  SELECT  ` list, or to eliminate redundancy in the output.

**Definitions**

  - `  groupable_items  ` : Group rows in a table that share common values for certain columns. To learn more, see [Group rows by groupable items](#group_by_grouping_item) .
  - `  ALL  ` : Automatically group rows. To learn more, see [Group rows automatically](#group_by_all) .
  - `  grouping_sets_specification  ` : Group rows with the `  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS  ` clause. To learn more, see [Group rows by `  GROUPING SETS  `](#group_by_grouping_sets) .
  - `  rollup_specification  ` : Group rows with the `  GROUP BY ROLLUP  ` clause. To learn more, see [Group rows by `  ROLLUP  `](#group_by_rollup) .
  - `  cube_specification  ` : Group rows with the `  GROUP BY CUBE  ` clause. To learn more, see [Group rows by `  CUBE  `](#group_by_cube) .
  - `  ()  ` : Group all rows and produce a grand total. Equivalent to no `  group_by_specification  ` .

### Group rows by groupable items

``` text
GROUP BY groupable_item[, ...]

groupable_item:
  {
    value
    | value_alias
    | column_ordinal
  }
```

**Description**

The `  GROUP BY  ` clause can include [groupable](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#data_type_properties) expressions and their ordinals.

**Definitions**

  - `  value  ` : An expression that represents a non-distinct, groupable value. To learn more, see [Group rows by values](#group_by_values) .
  - `  value_alias  ` : An alias for `  value  ` . To learn more, see [Group rows by values](#group_by_values) .
  - `  column_ordinal  ` : An `  INT64  ` value that represents the ordinal assigned to a groupable expression in the `  SELECT  ` list. To learn more, see [Group rows by column ordinals](#group_by_col_ordinals) .

#### Group rows by values

The `  GROUP BY  ` clause can group rows in a table with non-distinct values in the `  GROUP BY  ` clause. For example:

``` text
WITH PlayerStats AS (
  SELECT 'Adams' as LastName, 'Noam' as FirstName, 3 as PointsScored UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 0 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Coolidge', 'Kiran', 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Adams', 'Noam', 4 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 13)
SELECT SUM(PointsScored) AS total_points, LastName
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY LastName;

/*--------------+----------+
 | total_points | LastName |
 +--------------+----------+
 | 7            | Adams    |
 | 13           | Buchanan |
 | 1            | Coolidge |
 +--------------+----------*/
```

`  GROUP BY  ` clauses may also refer to aliases. If a query contains aliases in the `  SELECT  ` clause, those aliases override names in the corresponding `  FROM  ` clause. For example:

``` text
WITH PlayerStats AS (
  SELECT 'Adams' as LastName, 'Noam' as FirstName, 3 as PointsScored UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 0 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Coolidge', 'Kiran', 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Adams', 'Noam', 4 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 13)
SELECT SUM(PointsScored) AS total_points, LastName AS last_name
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY last_name;

/*--------------+-----------+
 | total_points | last_name |
 +--------------+-----------+
 | 7            | Adams     |
 | 13           | Buchanan  |
 | 1            | Coolidge  |
 +--------------+-----------*/
```

You can use the `  GROUP BY  ` clause with arrays. The following query executes because the array elements being grouped are the same length and group type:

``` text
WITH PlayerStats AS (
  SELECT ['Coolidge', 'Adams'] as Name, 3 as PointsScored UNION ALL
  SELECT ['Adams', 'Buchanan'], 0 UNION ALL
  SELECT ['Coolidge', 'Adams'], 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT ['Kiran', 'Noam'], 1)
SELECT SUM(PointsScored) AS total_points, name
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY Name;

/*--------------+------------------+
 | total_points | name             |
 +--------------+------------------+
 | 4            | [Coolidge,Adams] |
 | 0            | [Adams,Buchanan] |
 | 1            | [Kiran,Noam]     |
 +--------------+------------------*/
```

You can use the `  GROUP BY  ` clause with structs. The following query executes because the struct fields being grouped have the same group types:

``` text
WITH
  TeamStats AS (
    SELECT
      ARRAY<STRUCT<last_name STRING, first_name STRING, age INT64>>[
        ('Adams', 'Noam', 20), ('Buchanan', 'Jie', 19)] AS Team,
      3 AS PointsScored
    UNION ALL
    SELECT [('Coolidge', 'Kiran', 21), ('Yang', 'Jason', 22)], 4
    UNION ALL
    SELECT [('Adams', 'Noam', 20), ('Buchanan', 'Jie', 19)], 10
    UNION ALL
    SELECT [('Coolidge', 'Kiran', 21), ('Yang', 'Jason', 22)], 7
  )
SELECT
  SUM(PointsScored) AS total_points,
  Team
FROM TeamStats
GROUP BY Team;

/*--------------+--------------------------+
 | total_points | teams                    |
 +--------------+--------------------------+
 | 13           | [{                       |
 |              |    last_name: "Adams",   |
 |              |    first_name: "Noam",   |
 |              |    age: 20               |
 |              |  },{                     |
 |              |    last_name: "Buchanan",|
 |              |    first_name: "Jie",    |
 |              |    age: 19               |
 |              |  }]                      |
 +-----------------------------------------+
 | 11           | [{                       |
 |              |    last_name: "Coolidge",|
 |              |    first_name: "Kiran",  |
 |              |    age: 21               |
 |              |  },{                     |
 |              |    last_name: "Yang",    |
 |              |    first_name: "Jason",  |
 |              |    age: 22               |
 |              |  }]                      |
 +--------------+--------------------------*/
```

To learn more about the data types that are supported for values in the `  GROUP BY  ` clause, see [Groupable data types](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#data_type_properties) .

#### Group rows by column ordinals

The `  GROUP BY  ` clause can refer to expression names in the `  SELECT  ` list. The `  GROUP BY  ` clause also allows ordinal references to expressions in the `  SELECT  ` list, using integer values. `  1  ` refers to the first value in the `  SELECT  ` list, `  2  ` the second, and so forth. The value list can combine ordinals and value names. The following queries are equivalent:

``` text
WITH PlayerStats AS (
  SELECT 'Adams' as LastName, 'Noam' as FirstName, 3 as PointsScored UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 0 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Coolidge', 'Kiran', 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Adams', 'Noam', 4 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 13)
SELECT SUM(PointsScored) AS total_points, LastName, FirstName
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY LastName, FirstName;

/*--------------+----------+-----------+
 | total_points | LastName | FirstName |
 +--------------+----------+-----------+
 | 7            | Adams    | Noam      |
 | 13           | Buchanan | Jie       |
 | 1            | Coolidge | Kiran     |
 +--------------+----------+-----------*/
```

``` text
WITH PlayerStats AS (
  SELECT 'Adams' as LastName, 'Noam' as FirstName, 3 as PointsScored UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 0 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Coolidge', 'Kiran', 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Adams', 'Noam', 4 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 13)
SELECT SUM(PointsScored) AS total_points, LastName, FirstName
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY 2, 3;

/*--------------+----------+-----------+
 | total_points | LastName | FirstName |
 +--------------+----------+-----------+
 | 7            | Adams    | Noam      |
 | 13           | Buchanan | Jie       |
 | 1            | Coolidge | Kiran     |
 +--------------+----------+-----------*/
```

### Group rows by `     ALL    `

``` text
GROUP BY ALL
```

**Description**

The `  GROUP BY ALL  ` clause groups rows by inferring grouping keys from the `  SELECT  ` items.

The following `  SELECT  ` items are excluded from the `  GROUP BY ALL  ` clause:

  - Expressions that include [aggregate functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-function-calls) .
  - Expressions that include [window functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls) .
  - Expressions that don't reference a name from the `  FROM  ` clause. This includes:
      - Constants
      - Query parameters
      - Correlated column references
      - Expressions that only reference `  GROUP BY  ` keys inferred from other `  SELECT  ` items.

After exclusions are applied, an error is produced if any remaining `  SELECT  ` item includes a volatile function or has a non-groupable type.

If the set of inferred grouping keys is empty after exclusions are applied, all input rows are considered a single group for aggregation. This behavior is equivalent to writing `  GROUP BY ()  ` .

**Examples**

In the following example, the query groups rows by `  first_name  ` and `  last_name  ` . `  total_points  ` is excluded because it represents an aggregate function.

``` text
WITH PlayerStats AS (
  SELECT 'Adams' as LastName, 'Noam' as FirstName, 3 as PointsScored UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 0 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Coolidge', 'Kiran', 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Adams', 'Noam', 4 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 13)
SELECT
  SUM(PointsScored) AS total_points,
  FirstName AS first_name,
  LastName AS last_name
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY ALL;

/*--------------+------------+-----------+
 | total_points | first_name | last_name |
 +--------------+------------+-----------+
 | 7            | Noam       | Adams     |
 | 13           | Jie        | Buchanan  |
 | 1            | Kiran      | Coolidge  |
 +--------------+------------+-----------*/
```

If the select list contains an analytic function, the query groups rows by `  first_name  ` and `  last_name  ` . `  total_people  ` is excluded because it contains a window function.

``` text
WITH PlayerStats AS (
  SELECT 'Adams' as LastName, 'Noam' as FirstName, 3 as PointsScored UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 0 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Coolidge', 'Kiran', 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Adams', 'Noam', 4 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 'Jie', 13)
SELECT
  COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_people,
  FirstName AS first_name,
  LastName AS last_name
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY ALL;

/*--------------+------------+-----------+
 | total_people | first_name | last_name |
 +--------------+------------+-----------+
 | 3            | Noam       | Adams     |
 | 3            | Jie        | Buchanan  |
 | 3            | Kiran      | Coolidge  |
 +--------------+------------+-----------*/
```

If multiple `  SELECT  ` items reference the same `  FROM  ` item, and any of them is a path expression prefix of another, only the prefix path is used for grouping. In the following example, `  coordinates  ` is excluded because `  x_coordinate  ` and `  y_coordinate  ` have already referenced `  Values.x  ` and `  Values.y  ` in the `  FROM  ` clause, and they are prefixes of the path expression used in `  x_coordinate  ` :

``` text
WITH Values AS (
  SELECT 1 AS x, 2 AS y
  UNION ALL SELECT 1 AS x, 4 AS y
  UNION ALL SELECT 2 AS x, 5 AS y
)
SELECT
  Values.x AS x_coordinate,
  Values.y AS y_coordinate,
  [Values.x, Values.y] AS coordinates
FROM Values
GROUP BY ALL

/*--------------+--------------+-------------+
 | x_coordinate | y_coordinate | coordinates |
 +--------------+--------------+-------------+
 | 1            | 4            | [1, 4]      |
 | 1            | 2            | [1, 2]      |
 | 2            | 5            | [2, 5]      |
 +--------------+--------------+-------------*/
```

In the following example, the inferred set of grouping keys is empty. The query returns one row even when the input contains zero rows.

``` text
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_rows
FROM UNNEST([])
GROUP BY ALL

/*----------+
 | num_rows |
 +----------+
 | 0        |
 +----------*/
```

### Group rows by `     GROUPING SETS    `

``` text
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ( grouping_list )

grouping_list:
  {
    rollup_specification
    | cube_specification
    | groupable_item
    | groupable_item_set
  }[, ...]

groupable_item_set:
  ( [ groupable_item[, ...] ] )
```

**Description**

The `  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS  ` clause produces aggregated data for one or more *grouping sets* . A grouping set is a group of columns by which rows can be grouped together. This clause is helpful if you want to produce aggregated data for sets of data without using the `  UNION  ` operation. For example, `  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(x,y)  ` is roughly equivalent to `  GROUP BY x UNION ALL GROUP BY y  ` .

**Definitions**

  - `  grouping_list  ` : A list of items that you can add to the `  GROUPING SETS  ` clause. Grouping sets are generated based upon what is in this list.
  - `  rollup_specification  ` : Group rows with the `  ROLLUP  ` clause. Don't include `  GROUP BY  ` if you use this inside the `  GROUPING SETS  ` clause. To learn more, see [Group rows by `  ROLLUP  `](#group_by_rollup) .
  - `  cube_specification  ` : Group rows with the `  CUBE  ` clause. Don't include `  GROUP BY  ` if you use this inside the `  GROUPING SETS  ` clause. To learn more, see [Group rows by `  CUBE  `](#group_by_cube) .
  - `  groupable_item  ` : Group rows in a table that share common values for certain columns. To learn more, see [Group rows by groupable items](#group_by_grouping_item) . [Anonymous `  STRUCT  ` values](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#tuple_syntax) aren't allowed.
  - `  groupable_item_set  ` : Group rows by a set of [groupable items](#group_by_grouping_item) . If the set contains no groupable items, group all rows and produce a grand total.

**Details**

`  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS  ` works by taking a grouping list, generating grouping sets from it, and then producing a table as a union of queries grouped by each grouping set.

For example, `  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (a, b, c)  ` generates the following grouping sets from the grouping list, `  a, b, c  ` , and then produces aggregated rows for each of them:

  - `  (a)  `
  - `  (b)  `
  - `  (c)  `

Here is an example that includes groupable item sets in `  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (a, (b, c), d)  ` :

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Conceptual grouping sets</th>
<th>Actual grouping sets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a)      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       ((b, c))      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (b, c)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (d)      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (d)      </code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

`  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS  ` can include `  ROLLUP  ` and `  CUBE  ` operations, which generate grouping sets. If `  ROLLUP  ` is added, it generates rolled up grouping sets. If `  CUBE  ` is added, it generates grouping set permutations.

The following grouping sets are generated for `  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (a, ROLLUP(b, c), d)  ` .

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Conceptual grouping sets</th>
<th>Actual grouping sets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a)      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       ((b, c))      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (b, c)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       ((b))      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (b)      </code></td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (d)      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (d)      </code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The following grouping sets are generated for `  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (a, CUBE(b, c), d)  ` :

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Conceptual grouping sets</th>
<th>Actual grouping sets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

When evaluating the results for a particular grouping set, expressions that aren't in the grouping set are aggregated and produce a `  NULL  ` placeholder.

You can filter results for specific groupable items. To learn more, see the [`  GROUPING  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#grouping)

`  GROUPING SETS  ` allows up to 4096 groupable items.

**Examples**

The following queries produce the same results, but the first one uses `  GROUP BY GROUPING SETS  ` and the second one doesn't:

``` text

    SELECT 'pants', 'jeans', 6
  )
SELECT product_type, product_name, SUM(product_count) AS product_sum

### Group rows by `     ROLLUP    `

``` text
GROUP BY ROLLUP ( grouping_list )

grouping_list:
  { groupable_item | groupable_item_set }[, ...]

groupable_item_set:
  ( groupable_item[, ...] )
```

**Description**

The `  GROUP BY ROLLUP  ` clause produces aggregated data for rolled up *grouping sets* . A grouping set is a group of columns by which rows can be grouped together. This clause is helpful if you need to roll up totals in a set of data.

**Definitions**

  - `  grouping_list  ` : A list of items that you can add to the `  GROUPING SETS  ` clause. This is used to create a generated list of grouping sets when the query is run.
  - `  groupable_item  ` : Group rows in a table that share common values for certain columns. To learn more, see [Group rows by groupable items](#group_by_grouping_item) . [anonymous `  STRUCT  ` values](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#tuple_syntax) aren't allowed.
  - `  groupable_item_set  ` : Group rows by a subset of [groupable items](#group_by_grouping_item) .

**Details**

`  GROUP BY ROLLUP  ` works by taking a grouping list, generating grouping sets from the prefixes inside this list, and then producing a table as a union of queries grouped by each grouping set. The resulting grouping sets include an empty grouping set. In the empty grouping set, all rows are aggregated down to a single group.

For example, `  GROUP BY ROLLUP (a, b, c)  ` generates the following grouping sets from the grouping list, `  a, b, c  ` , and then produces aggregated rows for each of them:

  - `  (a, b, c)  `
  - `  (a, b)  `
  - `  (a)  `
  - `  ()  `

Here is an example that includes groupable item sets in `  GROUP BY ROLLUP (a, (b, c), d)  ` :

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Conceptual grouping sets</th>
<th>Actual grouping sets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a, (b, c), d)      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a, b, c, d)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a, (b, c))      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a, b, c)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a)      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       ()      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       ()      </code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When evaluating the results for a particular grouping set, expressions that aren't in the grouping set are aggregated and produce a `  NULL  ` placeholder.

You can filter results by specific groupable items. To learn more, see the [`  GROUPING  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#grouping)

`  ROLLUP  ` allows up to 4095 groupable items (equivalent to 4096 grouping sets).

**Examples**

The following queries produce the same subtotals and a grand total, but the first one uses `  GROUP BY  ` with `  ROLLUP  ` and the second one doesn't:

``` text
-- GROUP BY with ROLLUP
WITH
  Products AS (
    SELECT 'shirt' AS product_type, 't-shirt' AS product_name, 3 AS product_count UNION ALL

    SELECT 'shirt', 'polo', 25 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'pants', 'jeans', 6
  )
SELECT product_type, product_name, SUM(product_count) AS product_sum
FROM Products
GROUP BY ROLLUP (product_type, product_name)
ORDER BY product_type, product_name;

/*--------------+--------------+-------------+

 | shirt        | NULL         | 36          |
 | shirt        | t-shirt      | 11          |
 | shirt        | polo         | 25          |

### Group rows by `     CUBE    `

``` text
GROUP BY CUBE ( grouping_list )

grouping_list:
  { groupable_item | groupable_item_set }[, ...]

groupable_item_set:
  ( groupable_item[, ...] )
```

**Description**

The `  GROUP BY CUBE  ` clause produces aggregated data for all *grouping set* permutations. A grouping set is a group of columns by which rows can be grouped together. This clause is helpful if you need to create a [contingency table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table) to find interrelationships between items in a set of data.

**Definitions**

  - `  grouping_list  ` : A list of items that you can add to the `  GROUPING SETS  ` clause. This is used to create a generated list of grouping sets when the query is run.
  - `  groupable_item  ` : Group rows in a table that share common values for certain columns. To learn more, see [Group rows by groupable items](#group_by_grouping_item) . [Anonymous `  STRUCT  ` values](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#tuple_syntax) aren't allowed.
  - `  groupable_item_set  ` : Group rows by a set of [groupable items](#group_by_grouping_item) .

**Details**

`  GROUP BY CUBE  ` is similar to `  GROUP BY ROLLUP  ` , except that it takes a grouping list and generates grouping sets from all permutations in this list, including an empty grouping set. In the empty grouping set, all rows are aggregated down to a single group.

For example, `  GROUP BY CUBE (a, b, c)  ` generates the following grouping sets from the grouping list, `  a, b, c  ` , and then produces aggregated rows for each of them:

  - `  (a, b, c)  `
  - `  (a, b)  `
  - `  (a, c)  `
  - `  (a)  `
  - `  (b, c)  `
  - `  (b)  `
  - `  (c)  `
  - `  ()  `

Here is an example that includes groupable item sets in `  GROUP BY CUBE (a, (b, c), d)  ` :

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Conceptual grouping sets</th>
<th>Actual grouping sets</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a, (b, c), d)      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a, b, c, d)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<tr class="odd">

<tr class="even">

<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (a)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       ((b, c), d)      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (b, c, d)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       ((b, c))      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (b, c)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (d)      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       (d)      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       ()      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       ()      </code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

When evaluating the results for a particular grouping set, expressions that aren't in the grouping set are aggregated and produce a `  NULL  ` placeholder.

You can filter results by specific groupable items. To learn more, see the [`  GROUPING  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#grouping)

`  CUBE  ` allows up to 12 groupable items (equivalent to 4096 grouping sets).

**Examples**

The following query groups rows by all combinations of `  product_type  ` and `  product_name  ` to produce a contingency table:

``` text
-- GROUP BY with CUBE
WITH
  Products AS (
    SELECT 'shirt' AS product_type, 't-shirt' AS product_name, 3 AS product_count UNION ALL
    SELECT 'shirt', 't-shirt', 8 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'shirt', 'polo', 25 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'pants', 'jeans', 6
  )
SELECT product_type, product_name, SUM(product_count) AS product_sum
FROM Products
GROUP BY CUBE (product_type, product_name)
ORDER BY product_type, product_name;

/*--------------+--------------+-------------+
 | product_type | product_name | product_sum |
 +--------------+--------------+-------------+
 | NULL         | NULL         | 42          |
 | NULL         | jeans        | 6           |
 | NULL         | polo         | 25          |
 | NULL         | t-shirt      | 11          |
 | pants        | NULL         | 6           |
 | pants        | jeans        | 6           |
 | shirt        | NULL         | 36          |
 | shirt        | polo         | 25          |
 | shirt        | t-shirt      | 11          |
 +--------------+--------------+-------------*/
```

You can include groupable item sets in a `  GROUP BY CUBE  ` clause. In the following example, `  (product_type, product_name)  ` is a groupable item set.

``` text
WITH
  Products AS (
    SELECT 'shirt' AS product_type, 't-shirt' AS product_name, 3 AS product_count UNION ALL
    SELECT 'shirt', 't-shirt', 8 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'shirt', 'polo', 25 UNION ALL
    SELECT 'pants', 'jeans', 6
  )
SELECT product_type, product_name, SUM(product_count) AS product_sum
FROM Products
GROUP BY CUBE (product_type, (product_type, product_name))
ORDER BY product_type, product_name;

/*--------------+--------------+-------------+
 | product_type | product_name | product_sum |
 +--------------+--------------+-------------+
 | NULL         | NULL         | 42          |
 | pants        | NULL         | 6           |
 | pants        | jeans        | 6           |
 | pants        | jeans        | 6           |
 | shirt        | NULL         | 36          |
 | shirt        | polo         | 25          |
 | shirt        | polo         | 25          |
 | shirt        | t-shirt      | 11          |
 | shirt        | t-shirt      | 11          |
 +--------------+--------------+-------------*/
```

## `     HAVING    ` clause

``` text
HAVING bool_expression
```

The `  HAVING  ` clause filters the results produced by `  GROUP BY  ` or aggregation. `  GROUP BY  ` or aggregation must be present in the query. If aggregation is present, the `  HAVING  ` clause is evaluated once for every aggregated row in the result set.

Only rows whose `  bool_expression  ` evaluates to `  TRUE  ` are included. Rows whose `  bool_expression  ` evaluates to `  NULL  ` or `  FALSE  ` are discarded.

The evaluation of a query with a `  HAVING  ` clause is typically completed in this order:

  - `  FROM  `
  - `  WHERE  `
  - `  GROUP BY  ` and aggregation
  - `  HAVING  `
  - `  WINDOW  `
  - `  QUALIFY  `
  - `  DISTINCT  `
  - `  ORDER BY  `
  - `  LIMIT  `

Evaluation order doesn't always match syntax order.

The `  HAVING  ` clause references columns available via the `  FROM  ` clause, as well as `  SELECT  ` list aliases. Expressions referenced in the `  HAVING  ` clause must either appear in the `  GROUP BY  ` clause or they must be the result of an aggregate function:

``` text
SELECT LastName
FROM Roster
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING SUM(PointsScored) > 15;
```

If a query contains aliases in the `  SELECT  ` clause, those aliases override names in a `  FROM  ` clause.

``` text
SELECT LastName, SUM(PointsScored) AS ps
FROM Roster
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING ps > 0;
```

### Mandatory aggregation

Aggregation doesn't have to be present in the `  HAVING  ` clause itself, but aggregation must be present in at least one of the following forms:

#### Aggregation function in the `     SELECT    ` list.

``` text
SELECT LastName, SUM(PointsScored) AS total
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING total > 15;
```

#### Aggregation function in the `     HAVING    ` clause.

``` text
SELECT LastName
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING SUM(PointsScored) > 15;
```

#### Aggregation in both the `     SELECT    ` list and `     HAVING    ` clause.

When aggregation functions are present in both the `  SELECT  ` list and `  HAVING  ` clause, the aggregation functions and the columns they reference don't need to be the same. In the example below, the two aggregation functions, `  COUNT()  ` and `  SUM()  ` , are different and also use different columns.

``` text
SELECT LastName, COUNT(*)
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING SUM(PointsScored) > 15;
```

## `     ORDER BY    ` clause

``` text
ORDER BY expression
  [{ ASC | DESC }]
  [{ NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST }]
  [, ...]
```

The `  ORDER BY  ` clause specifies a column or expression as the sort criterion for the result set. If an `  ORDER BY  ` clause isn't present, the order of the results of a query isn't defined. Column aliases from a `  FROM  ` clause or `  SELECT  ` list are allowed. If a query contains aliases in the `  SELECT  ` clause, those aliases override names in the corresponding `  FROM  ` clause. The data type of `  expression  ` must be [orderable](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#orderable_data_types) .

**Optional Clauses**

  - `  NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST  ` :
      - `  NULLS FIRST  ` : Sort null values before non-null values.
      - `  NULLS LAST  ` . Sort null values after non-null values.
  - `  ASC | DESC  ` : Sort the results in ascending or descending order of `  expression  ` values. `  ASC  ` is the default value. If null ordering isn't specified with `  NULLS FIRST  ` or `  NULLS LAST  ` :
      - `  NULLS FIRST  ` is applied by default if the sort order is ascending.
      - `  NULLS LAST  ` is applied by default if the sort order is descending.

**Examples**

Use the default sort order (ascending).

``` text
SELECT x, y
FROM (SELECT 1 AS x, true AS y UNION ALL
      SELECT 9, true UNION ALL
      SELECT NULL, false)
ORDER BY x;

/*------+-------+
 | x    | y     |
 +------+-------+
 | NULL | false |
 | 1    | true  |
 | 9    | true  |
 +------+-------*/
```

Use the default sort order (ascending), but return null values last.

``` text
SELECT x, y
FROM (SELECT 1 AS x, true AS y UNION ALL
      SELECT 9, true UNION ALL
      SELECT NULL, false)
ORDER BY x NULLS LAST;

/*------+-------+
 | x    | y     |
 +------+-------+
 | 1    | true  |
 | 9    | true  |
 | NULL | false |
 +------+-------*/
```

Use descending sort order.

``` text
SELECT x, y
FROM (SELECT 1 AS x, true AS y UNION ALL
      SELECT 9, true UNION ALL
      SELECT NULL, false)
ORDER BY x DESC;

/*------+-------+
 | x    | y     |
 +------+-------+
 | 9    | true  |
 | 1    | true  |
 | NULL | false |
 +------+-------*/
```

Use descending sort order, but return null values first.

``` text
SELECT x, y
FROM (SELECT 1 AS x, true AS y UNION ALL
      SELECT 9, true UNION ALL
      SELECT NULL, false)
ORDER BY x DESC NULLS FIRST;

/*------+-------+
 | x    | y     |
 +------+-------+
 | NULL | false |
 | 9    | true  |
 | 1    | true  |
 +------+-------*/
```

It's possible to order by multiple columns. In the example below, the result set is ordered first by `  SchoolID  ` and then by `  LastName  ` :

``` text
SELECT LastName, PointsScored, OpponentID
FROM PlayerStats
ORDER BY SchoolID, LastName;
```

When used in conjunction with [set operators](#set_operators) , the `  ORDER BY  ` clause applies to the result set of the entire query; it doesn't apply only to the closest `  SELECT  ` statement. For this reason, it can be helpful (though it isn't required) to use parentheses to show the scope of the `  ORDER BY  ` .

This query without parentheses:

``` text
SELECT * FROM Roster
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM TeamMascot
ORDER BY SchoolID;
```

is equivalent to this query with parentheses:

``` text
( SELECT * FROM Roster
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM TeamMascot )
ORDER BY SchoolID;
```

but isn't equivalent to this query, where the `  ORDER BY  ` clause applies only to the second `  SELECT  ` statement:

``` text
SELECT * FROM Roster
UNION ALL
( SELECT * FROM TeamMascot
  ORDER BY SchoolID );
```

You can also use integer literals as column references in `  ORDER BY  ` clauses. An integer literal becomes an ordinal (for example, counting starts at 1) into the `  SELECT  ` list.

Example - the following two queries are equivalent:

``` text
SELECT SUM(PointsScored), LastName
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY LastName
ORDER BY LastName;
```

``` text
SELECT SUM(PointsScored), LastName
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY 2;
```

## `     QUALIFY    ` clause

``` text
QUALIFY bool_expression
```

The `  QUALIFY  ` clause filters the results of window functions. A window function is required to be present in the `  QUALIFY  ` clause or the `  SELECT  ` list.

Only rows whose `  bool_expression  ` evaluates to `  TRUE  ` are included. Rows whose `  bool_expression  ` evaluates to `  NULL  ` or `  FALSE  ` are discarded.

The evaluation of a query with a `  QUALIFY  ` clause is typically completed in this order:

  - `  FROM  `
  - `  WHERE  `
  - `  GROUP BY  ` and aggregation
  - `  HAVING  `
  - `  WINDOW  `
  - `  QUALIFY  `
  - `  DISTINCT  `
  - `  ORDER BY  `
  - `  LIMIT  `

Evaluation order doesn't always match syntax order.

**Examples**

The following query returns the most popular vegetables in the [`  Produce  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls#produce_table) table and their rank.

``` text
SELECT
  item,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY purchases DESC) as rank
FROM Produce
WHERE Produce.category = 'vegetable'
QUALIFY rank <= 3

/*---------+------+
 | item    | rank |
 +---------+------+
 | kale    | 1    |
 | lettuce | 2    |
 | cabbage | 3    |
 +---------+------*/
```

You don't have to include a window function in the `  SELECT  ` list to use `  QUALIFY  ` . The following query returns the most popular vegetables in the [`  Produce  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls#produce_table) table.

``` text
SELECT item
FROM Produce
WHERE Produce.category = 'vegetable'
QUALIFY RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY purchases DESC) <= 3

/*---------+
 | item    |
 +---------+
 | kale    |
 | lettuce |
 | cabbage |
 +---------*/
```

## `     WINDOW    ` clause

``` text
WINDOW named_window_expression [, ...]

named_window_expression:
  named_window AS { named_window | ( [ window_specification ] ) }
```

A `  WINDOW  ` clause defines a list of named windows. A named window represents a group of rows in a table upon which to use a [window function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls) . A named window can be defined with a [window specification](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls#def_window_spec) or reference another named window. If another named window is referenced, the definition of the referenced window must precede the referencing window.

**Examples**

These examples reference a table called [`  Produce  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls#produce_table) . They all return the same [result](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls#def_use_named_window) . Note the different ways you can combine named windows and use them in a window function's `  OVER  ` clause.

``` text
SELECT item, purchases, category, LAST_VALUE(item)
  OVER (item_window) AS most_popular
FROM Produce
WINDOW item_window AS (
  PARTITION BY category
  ORDER BY purchases
  ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING)
```

``` text
SELECT item, purchases, category, LAST_VALUE(item)
  OVER (d) AS most_popular
FROM Produce
WINDOW
  a AS (PARTITION BY category),
  b AS (a ORDER BY purchases),
  c AS (b ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING),
  d AS (c)
```

``` text
SELECT item, purchases, category, LAST_VALUE(item)
  OVER (c ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING) AS most_popular
FROM Produce
WINDOW
  a AS (PARTITION BY category),
  b AS (a ORDER BY purchases),
  c AS b
```

## Set operators

``` text
  query_expr
  [ { INNER | [ { FULL | LEFT } [ OUTER ] ] } ]
  {
    UNION { ALL | DISTINCT } |
    INTERSECT DISTINCT |
    EXCEPT DISTINCT
  }
  [ { BY NAME [ ON (column_list) ] | [ STRICT ] CORRESPONDING [ BY (column_list) ] } ]
  query_expr
```

Set operators combine or filter results from two or more input queries into a single result set.

**Definitions**

  - `  query_expr  ` : One of two input queries whose results are combined or filtered into a single result set.
  - `  UNION  ` : Returns the combined results of the left and right input queries. Values in columns that are matched by position are concatenated vertically.
  - `  INTERSECT  ` : Returns rows that are found in the results of both the left and right input queries.
  - `  EXCEPT  ` : Returns rows from the left input query that aren't present in the right input query.
  - `  ALL  ` : Executes the set operation on all rows.
  - `  DISTINCT  ` : Excludes duplicate rows in the set operation.
  - `  BY NAME  ` , `  CORRESPONDING  ` : Matches columns by name instead of by position. The `  BY NAME  ` modifier is equivalent to `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` . For details, see [`  BY NAME  ` or `  CORRESPONDING  `](#by_name_or_corresponding) .
  - `  INNER  ` , `  FULL | LEFT [OUTER]  ` , `  STRICT  ` , `  ON  ` , `  BY  ` : Adjust how the `  BY NAME  ` or `  CORRESPONDING  ` modifier behaves when the column names don't match exactly. For details, see [`  BY NAME  ` or `  CORRESPONDING  `](#by_name_or_corresponding) .

**Positional column matching**

By default, columns are matched positionally and follow these rules. If the `  BY NAME  ` or `  CORRESPONDING  ` modifier is used, columns are matched by name, as described in the next section.

  - Columns from input queries are matched by their position in the queries. That is, the first column in the first input query is paired with the first column in the second input query and so on.
  - The input queries on each side of the operator must return the same number of columns.

**Name-based column matching**

To make set operations match columns by name instead of by column position, use the [`  BY NAME  ` or `  CORRESPONDING  `](#by_name_or_corresponding) modifier.

With `  BY NAME  ` or `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` , the same column names must exist in each input, but they can be in different orders. Additional modifiers can be used to handle cases where the columns don't exactly match.

The `  BY NAME  ` modifier is equivalent to `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` , but the `  BY NAME  ` modifier is recommended because it's shorter and clearer.

Example:

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
UNION ALL BY NAME
SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit;

-- Column values match by name and not position in query.
/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 | 2         | 20        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

**Other column-related rules**

  - For set operations other than `  UNION ALL  ` , all column types must support equality comparison.
  - The results of the set operation always use the column names from the first input query.
  - The results of the set operation always use the supertypes of input types in corresponding columns, so paired columns must also have either the same data type or a common supertype.

**Parenthesized set operators**

  - Parentheses must be used to separate different set operations. Set operations like `  UNION ALL  ` and `  UNION DISTINCT  ` are considered different.
  - Parentheses are also used to group set operations and control order of operations. In `  EXCEPT  ` set operations, for example, query results can vary depending on the operation grouping.

The following examples illustrate the use of parentheses with set operations:

``` text
-- Same set operations, no parentheses.
query1
UNION ALL
query2
UNION ALL
query3;
```

``` text
-- Different set operations, parentheses needed.
query1
UNION ALL
(
  query2
  UNION DISTINCT
  query3
);
```

``` text
-- Invalid
query1
UNION ALL
query2
UNION DISTINCT
query3;
```

``` text
-- Same set operations, no parentheses.
query1
EXCEPT DISTINCT
query2
EXCEPT DISTINCT
query3;

-- Equivalent query with optional parentheses, returns same results.
(
  query1
  EXCEPT DISTINCT
  query2
)
EXCEPT DISTINCT
query3;
```

``` text
-- Different execution order with a subquery, parentheses needed.
query1
EXCEPT DISTINCT
(
  query2
  EXCEPT DISTINCT
  query3
);
```

**Set operator behavior with duplicate rows**

Consider a given row `  R  ` that appears exactly `  m  ` times in the first input query and `  n  ` times in the second input query, where `  m >= 0  ` and `  n >= 0  ` :

  - For `  UNION ALL  ` , row `  R  ` appears exactly `  m + n  ` times in the result.
  - For `  UNION DISTINCT  ` , the `  DISTINCT  ` is computed after the `  UNION  ` is computed, so row `  R  ` appears exactly one time.
  - For `  INTERSECT DISTINCT  ` , row `  R  ` appears once in the output if `  m > 0  ` and `  n > 0  ` .
  - For `  EXCEPT DISTINCT  ` , row `  R  ` appears once in the output if `  m > 0  ` and `  n = 0  ` .
  - If more than two input queries are used, the above operations generalize and the output is the same as if the input queries were combined incrementally from left to right.

**BY NAME or CORRESPONDING**

Use the `  BY NAME  ` or `  CORRESPONDING  ` modifier with set operations to match columns by name instead of by position. The `  BY NAME  ` modifier is equivalent to `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` , but the `  BY NAME  ` modifier is recommended because it's shorter and clearer. You can use mode prefixes to adjust how the `  BY NAME  ` or `  CORRESPONDING  ` modifier behaves when the column names don't match exactly.

  - `  BY NAME  ` : Matches columns by name instead of by position.
      - Both input queries must have the same set of column names, but column order can be different. If a column in one input query doesn't appear in the other query, an error is raised.
      - Input queries can't contain duplicate columns.
      - Input queries that produce [value tables](#value_tables) aren't supported.
  - `  INNER  ` : Adjusts the `  BY NAME  ` modifier behavior so that columns that appear in both input queries are included in the query results and any other columns are excluded.
      - No error is raised for the excluded columns that appear in one input query but not in the other input query.
      - At least one column must be common in both left and right input queries.
  - `  FULL [OUTER]  ` : Adjusts the `  BY NAME  ` modifier behavior so that all columns from both input queries are included in the query results, even if some columns aren't present in both queries.
      - Columns from the left input query are returned first, followed by unique columns from the right input query.
      - For columns in one input query that aren't present in the other query, a `  NULL  ` value is added as its column value for the other query in the results.
  - `  LEFT [OUTER]  ` : Adjusts the `  BY NAME  ` modifier so that all columns from the left input query are included in the results, even if some columns in the left query aren't present in the right query.
      - For columns in the left query that aren't in the right query, a `  NULL  ` value is added as its column value for the right query in the results.
      - At least one column name must be common in both left and right input queries.
  - `  OUTER  ` : If used alone, equivalent to `  FULL OUTER  ` .
  - `  ON (column_list)  ` : Used after the `  BY NAME  ` modifier to specify a comma-separated list of column names and the column order to return from the input queries.
      - If `  BY NAME ON (column_list)  ` is used alone without mode prefixes like `  INNER  ` or `  FULL | LEFT [OUTER]  ` , then both the left and right input queries must contain all the columns in the `  column_list  ` .
      - If any mode prefixes are used, then any column names not in the `  column_list  ` are excluded from the results according to the mode used.
  - `  CORRESPONDING  ` : Equivalent to `  INNER...BY NAME  ` .
      - Supports `  FULL | LEFT [OUTER]  ` modes the same way they're supported by the `  BY NAME  ` modifier.
      - Supports `  INNER  ` mode, but this mode has no effect. The `  INNER  ` mode is used with the `  BY NAME  ` modifier to exclude unmatched columns between input queries, which is the default behavior of the `  CORRESPONDING  ` modifier. Therefore, using `  INNER...CORRESPONDING  ` produces the same results as `  CORRESPONDING  ` .
  - `  STRICT  ` : Adjusts the `  CORRESPONDING  ` modifier to be equivalent to the default `  BY NAME  ` modifier, where input queries must have the same set of column names.
  - `  BY (column_list)  ` : Equivalent to `  ON (column_list)  ` with `  BY NAME  ` .

The following table shows the equivalent syntaxes between the `  BY NAME  ` and `  CORRESPONDING  ` modifiers, using the `  UNION ALL  ` set operator as an example:

For example set operations with modifiers, see the sections for each set operator, such as [`  UNION  `](#union) .

### `     UNION    `

The `  UNION  ` operator returns the combined results of the left and right input queries. Columns are matched according to the rules described previously and rows are concatenated vertically.

**Examples**

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3]) AS number
UNION ALL
SELECT 1;

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 1      |
 | 2      |
 | 3      |
 | 1      |
 +--------*/
```

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3]) AS number
UNION DISTINCT
SELECT 1;

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 1      |
 | 2      |
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example shows multiple chained operators:

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3]) AS number
UNION DISTINCT
SELECT 1
UNION DISTINCT
SELECT 2;

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 1      |
 | 2      |
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example shows input queries with multiple columns. Both queries specify the same column names but in different orders. As a result, the column values are matched by column position in the input query and the column names are ignored.

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
UNION ALL
SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit;

-- Column values are matched by position and not column name.
/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 | 20        | 2         |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

To resolve this ordering issue, the following example uses the `  BY NAME  ` modifier to match the columns by name instead of by position in the query results.

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
UNION ALL BY NAME
SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit;

-- Column values now match.
/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 | 2         | 20        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

The previous set operation with `  BY NAME  ` is equivalent to using the `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` modifier. The `  BY NAME  ` modifier is recommended because it's shorter and clearer than the `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` modifier.

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
UNION ALL STRICT CORRESPONDING
SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit;

/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 | 2         | 20        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

The following example adds a `  three_digit  ` column to the left input query and a `  four_digit  ` column to the right input query. Because these columns aren't present in both queries, the `  BY NAME  ` modifier would trigger an error. Therefore, the example adds the `  INNER  ` mode prefix so that the new columns are excluded from the results, executing the query successfully.

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit, 100 AS three_digit
INNER UNION ALL BY NAME
SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit, 1000 AS four_digit;

/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 | 2         | 20        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

To include the differing columns in the results, the following example uses the `  FULL OUTER  ` mode prefix to populate `  NULL  ` values for the missing column in each query.

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit, 100 AS three_digit
FULL OUTER UNION ALL BY NAME
SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit, 1000 AS four_digit;

/*-----------+-----------+-------------+------------+
 | one_digit | two_digit | three_digit | four_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+-------------+------------+
 | 1         | 10        | 100         | NULL       |
 | 2         | 20        | NULL        | 1000       |
 +-----------+-----------+-------------+------------*/
```

Similarly, the following example uses the `  LEFT OUTER  ` mode prefix to include the new column from only the left input query and populate a `  NULL  ` value for the missing column in the right input query.

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit, 100 AS three_digit
LEFT OUTER UNION ALL BY NAME
SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit, 1000 AS four_digit;

/*-----------+-----------+-------------+
 | one_digit | two_digit | three_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+-------------+
 | 1         | 10        | 100         |
 | 2         | 20        | NULL        |
 +-----------+-----------+-------------*/
```

The following example adds the modifier `  ON (column_list)  ` to return only the specified columns in the specified order.

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit, 100 AS three_digit
FULL OUTER UNION ALL BY NAME ON (three_digit, two_digit)
SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit, 1000 AS four_digit;

/*-------------+-----------+
 | three_digit | two_digit |
 +-------------+-----------+
 | 100         | 10        |
 | NULL        | 20        |
 +-----------+-------------*/
```

### `     INTERSECT    `

The `  INTERSECT  ` operator returns rows that are found in the results of both the left and right input queries.

**Examples**

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
INTERSECT DISTINCT
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[2, 3, 3, 5]) AS number;

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 2      |
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example shows multiple chained operations:

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
INTERSECT DISTINCT
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[2, 3, 3, 5]) AS number
INTERSECT DISTINCT
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[3, 3, 4, 5]) AS number;

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example shows input queries that specify multiple columns. Both queries specify the same column names but in different orders. As a result, the same columns in differing order are considered different columns, so the query doesn't detect any intersecting row values. Therefore, no results are returned.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
INTERSECT DISTINCT
SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit;

-- No intersecting values detected because columns aren't recognized as the same.
/*-----------+-----------+

 +-----------+-----------*/
```

To resolve this ordering issue, the following example uses the `  BY NAME  ` modifier to match the columns by name instead of by position in the query results.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
INTERSECT DISTINCT BY NAME
SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit;

/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

The previous set operation with `  BY NAME  ` is equivalent to using the `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` modifier. The `  BY NAME  ` modifier is recommended because it's shorter and clearer than the `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` modifier.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
INTERSECT DISTINCT STRICT CORRESPONDING
SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit;

/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

For more syntax examples with the `  BY NAME  ` modifier, see the [`  UNION  `](#union) set operator.

### `     EXCEPT    `

The `  EXCEPT  ` operator returns rows from the left input query that aren't present in the right input query.

**Examples**

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2]) AS number;

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 3      |
 | 4      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example shows multiple chained operations:

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2]) AS number
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 4]) AS number;

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example modifies the execution behavior of the set operations. The first input query is used against the result of the last two input queries instead of the values of the last two queries individually. In this example, the `  EXCEPT  ` result of the last two input queries is `  2  ` . Therefore, the `  EXCEPT  ` results of the entire query are any values other than `  2  ` in the first input query.

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
EXCEPT DISTINCT
(
  SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2]) AS number
  EXCEPT DISTINCT
  SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 4]) AS number
);

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 1      |
 | 3      |
 | 4      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example shows input queries that specify multiple columns. Both queries specify the same column names but in different orders. As a result, the same columns in differing order are considered different columns, so the query doesn't detect any common rows that should be excluded. Therefore, all column values from the left input query are returned with no exclusions.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit;

-- No values excluded because columns aren't recognized as the same.
/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 | 2         | 20        |
 | 3         | 30        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

To resolve this ordering issue, the following example uses the `  BY NAME  ` modifier to match the columns by name instead of by position in the query results.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
EXCEPT DISTINCT BY NAME
SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit;

/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 2         | 20        |
 | 3         | 30        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

The previous set operation with `  BY NAME  ` is equivalent to using the `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` modifier. The `  BY NAME  ` modifier is recommended because it's shorter and clearer than the `  STRICT CORRESPONDING  ` modifier.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
EXCEPT DISTINCT STRICT CORRESPONDING
SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit;

/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 2         | 20        |
 | 3         | 30        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

## `     LIMIT    ` and `     OFFSET    ` clause

``` text
LIMIT count [ OFFSET skip_rows ]
```

Limits the number of rows to return in a query. Optionally includes the ability to skip over rows.

**Definitions**

  - `  LIMIT  ` : Limits the number of rows to produce.
    
    `  count  ` is an `  INT64  ` constant expression that represents the non-negative, non- `  NULL  ` limit. No more than `  count  ` rows are produced. `  LIMIT 0  ` returns 0 rows.
    
    If there is a set operation, `  LIMIT  ` is applied after the set operation is evaluated.

  - `  OFFSET  ` : Skips a specific number of rows before applying `  LIMIT  ` .
    
    `  skip_rows  ` is an `  INT64  ` constant expression that represents the non-negative, non- `  NULL  ` number of rows to skip.

**Details**

The rows that are returned by `  LIMIT  ` and `  OFFSET  ` have undefined order unless these clauses are used after `  ORDER BY  ` .

A constant expression can be represented by a general expression, literal, or parameter value.

**Note:** Although the `  LIMIT  ` clause limits the rows that a query produces, it doesn't limit the amount of data processed by that query.

**Examples**

``` text
SELECT *
FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<STRING>['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']) AS letter
ORDER BY letter ASC LIMIT 2;

/*---------+
 | letter  |
 +---------+
 | a       |
 | b       |
 +---------*/
```

``` text
SELECT *
FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<STRING>['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']) AS letter
ORDER BY letter ASC LIMIT 3 OFFSET 1;

/*---------+
 | letter  |
 +---------+
 | b       |
 | c       |
 | d       |
 +---------*/
```

## `     WITH    ` clause

``` text
WITH [ RECURSIVE ] { non_recursive_cte | recursive_cte }[, ...]
```

A `  WITH  ` clause contains one or more common table expressions (CTEs). A CTE acts like a temporary table that you can reference within a single query expression. Each CTE binds the results of a [subquery](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries) to a table name, which can be used elsewhere in the same query expression, but [rules apply](#cte_rules) .

CTEs can be [non-recursive](#simple_cte) or [recursive](#recursive_cte) and you can include both of these in your `  WITH  ` clause. A recursive CTE references itself, where a non-recursive CTE doesn't. If a recursive CTE is included in the `  WITH  ` clause, the `  RECURSIVE  ` keyword must also be included.

You can include the `  RECURSIVE  ` keyword in a `  WITH  ` clause even if no recursive CTEs are present. You can learn more about the `  RECURSIVE  ` keyword [here](#recursive_keyword) .

GoogleSQL only materializes the results of recursive CTEs, but doesn't materialize the results of non-recursive CTEs inside the `  WITH  ` clause. If a non-recursive CTE is referenced in multiple places in a query, then the CTE is executed once for each reference. The `  WITH  ` clause with non-recursive CTEs is useful primarily for readability.

### `     RECURSIVE    ` keyword

A `  WITH  ` clause can optionally include the `  RECURSIVE  ` keyword, which does two things:

  - Enables recursion in the `  WITH  ` clause. If this keyword isn't present, you can only include non-recursive common table expressions (CTEs). If this keyword is present, you can use both [recursive](#recursive_cte) and [non-recursive](#simple_cte) CTEs.
  - [Changes the visibility](#cte_visibility) of CTEs in the `  WITH  ` clause. If this keyword isn't present, a CTE is only visible to CTEs defined after it in the `  WITH  ` clause. If this keyword is present, a CTE is visible to all CTEs in the `  WITH  ` clause where it was defined.

### Non-recursive CTEs

``` text
non_recursive_cte:
  cte_name AS ( query_expr )
```

A non-recursive common table expression (CTE) contains a non-recursive [subquery](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries) and a name associated with the CTE.

  - A non-recursive CTE can't reference itself.
  - A non-recursive CTE can be referenced by the query expression that contains the `  WITH  ` clause, but [rules apply](#cte_rules) .

##### Examples

In this example, a `  WITH  ` clause defines two non-recursive CTEs that are referenced in the related set operation, where one CTE is referenced by each of the set operation's input query expressions:

``` text
WITH subQ1 AS (SELECT SchoolID FROM Roster),
     subQ2 AS (SELECT OpponentID FROM PlayerStats)
SELECT * FROM subQ1
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM subQ2
```

You can break up more complex queries into a `  WITH  ` clause and `  WITH  ` `  SELECT  ` statement instead of writing nested table subqueries. For example:

``` text
WITH q1 AS (my_query)
SELECT *
FROM
  (WITH q2 AS (SELECT * FROM q1) SELECT * FROM q2)
```

``` text
WITH q1 AS (my_query)
SELECT *
FROM
  (WITH q2 AS (SELECT * FROM q1),  # q1 resolves to my_query
        q3 AS (SELECT * FROM q1),  # q1 resolves to my_query
        q1 AS (SELECT * FROM q1),  # q1 (in the query) resolves to my_query
        q4 AS (SELECT * FROM q1)   # q1 resolves to the WITH subquery on the previous line.
    SELECT * FROM q1)              # q1 resolves to the third inner WITH subquery.
```

### Recursive CTEs

``` text
recursive_cte:
  cte_name AS ( recursive_union_operation )

recursive_union_operation:
  base_term union_operator recursive_term

base_term:
  query_expr

recursive_term:
  query_expr

union_operator:
  UNION ALL
```

A recursive common table expression (CTE) contains a recursive [subquery](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries) and a name associated with the CTE.

  - A recursive CTE references itself.
  - A recursive CTE can be referenced in the query expression that contains the `  WITH  ` clause, but [rules apply](#cte_rules) .
  - When a recursive CTE is defined in a `  WITH  ` clause, the [`  RECURSIVE  `](#recursive_keyword) keyword must be present.

A recursive CTE is defined by a *recursive union operation* . The recursive union operation defines how input is recursively processed to produce the final CTE result. The recursive union operation has the following parts:

  - `  base_term  ` : Runs the first iteration of the recursive union operation. This term must follow the [base term rules](#base_term_rules) .
  - `  union_operator  ` : The `  UNION  ` operator returns the rows that are from the union of the base term and recursive term. With `  UNION ALL  ` , each row produced in iteration `  N  ` becomes part of the final CTE result and input for iteration `  N+1  ` . Iteration stops when an iteration produces no rows to move into the next iteration.
  - `  recursive_term  ` : Runs the remaining iterations. It must include one self-reference (recursive reference) to the recursive CTE. Only this term can include a self-reference. This term must follow the [recursive term rules](#recursive_cte_rules) .

A recursive CTE looks like this:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS ( (SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (SELECT n + 1 AS n FROM T1 WHERE n < 3) )
SELECT n FROM T1

/*---+
 | n |
 +---+
 | 2 |
 | 1 |
 | 3 |
 +---*/
```

The first iteration of a recursive union operation runs the base term. Then, each subsequent iteration runs the recursive term and produces *new rows* which are unioned with the previous iteration. The recursive union operation terminates when a recursive term iteration produces no new rows.

If recursion doesn't terminate, the query fails after reaching 500 iterations.

To learn more about recursive CTEs and troubleshooting iteration limit errors, see [Work with recursive CTEs](/bigquery/docs/recursive-ctes) .

##### Examples of allowed recursive CTEs

This is a simple recursive CTE:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS (
    (SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL
    (SELECT n + 2 FROM T1 WHERE n < 4))
SELECT * FROM T1 ORDER BY n

/*---+
 | n |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 | 3 |
 | 5 |
 +---*/
```

Multiple subqueries in the same recursive CTE are okay, as long as each recursion has a cycle length of 1. It's also okay for recursive entries to depend on non-recursive entries and vice-versa:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T0 AS (SELECT 1 AS n),
  T1 AS ((SELECT * FROM T0) UNION ALL (SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 WHERE n < 4)),
  T2 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (SELECT n + 1 FROM T2 WHERE n < 4)),
  T3 AS (SELECT * FROM T1 INNER JOIN T2 USING (n))
SELECT * FROM T3 ORDER BY n

/*---+
 | n |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 | 2 |
 | 3 |
 | 4 |
 +---*/
```

Aggregate functions can be invoked in subqueries, as long as they aren't aggregating on the table being defined:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T0 AS (SELECT * FROM UNNEST ([60, 20, 30])),
  T1 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (SELECT n + (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM T0) FROM T1 WHERE n < 4))
SELECT * FROM T1 ORDER BY n

/*---+
 | n |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 | 4 |
 +---*/
```

`  INNER JOIN  ` can be used inside subqueries:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T0 AS (SELECT 1 AS n),
  T1 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 INNER JOIN T0 USING (n)))
SELECT * FROM T1 ORDER BY n

/*---+
 | n |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 | 2 |
 +---*/
```

`  CROSS JOIN  ` can be used inside subqueries:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T0 AS (SELECT 2 AS p),
  T1 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (SELECT T1.n + T0.p FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T0 WHERE T1.n < 4))
SELECT * FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T0 ORDER BY n

/*---+---+
 | n | p |
 +---+---+
 | 1 | 2 |
 | 3 | 2 |
 | 5 | 2 |
 +---+---*/
```

Recursive CTEs can be used inside `  CREATE TABLE AS SELECT  ` statements. The following example creates a table named `  new_table  ` in `  mydataset  ` :

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `myproject.mydataset.new_table` AS
  WITH RECURSIVE
    T1 AS (SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 WHERE n < 3)
  SELECT * FROM T1
```

Recursive CTEs can be used inside `  CREATE VIEW AS SELECT  ` statements. The following example creates a view named `  new_view  ` in `  mydataset  ` :

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `myproject.mydataset.new_view` AS
  WITH RECURSIVE
    T1 AS (SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 WHERE n < 3)
  SELECT * FROM T1
```

Recursive CTEs can be used inside `  INSERT  ` statements. The following example demonstrates how to insert data into a table by using recursive CTEs:

``` text
-- create a temp table.
CREATE TEMP TABLE tmp_table (n INT64);

-- insert some values into the temp table by using recursive CTEs.
INSERT INTO tmp_table(n)
  WITH RECURSIVE
    T1 AS (SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 WHERE n < 3)
  SELECT * FROM T1
```

##### Examples of disallowed recursive CTEs

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because the self-reference doesn't include a set operator, base term, and recursive term.

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS (SELECT * FROM T1)
SELECT * FROM T1

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because the self-reference to `  T1  ` is in the base term. The self reference is only allowed in the recursive term.

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS ((SELECT * FROM T1) UNION ALL (SELECT 1))
SELECT * FROM T1

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because there are multiple self-references in the recursive term when there must only be one.

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL ((SELECT * FROM T1) UNION ALL (SELECT * FROM T1)))
SELECT * FROM T1

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because the self-reference is inside an [expression subquery](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries#expression_subquery_concepts)

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (SELECT (SELECT n FROM T1)))
SELECT * FROM T1

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because there is a self-reference as an argument to a table-valued function (TVF).

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS (
    (SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL
    (SELECT * FROM MY_TVF(T1)))
SELECT * FROM T1;

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because there is a self-reference as input to an outer join.

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T0 AS (SELECT 1 AS n),
  T1 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (SELECT * FROM T1 FULL OUTER JOIN T0 USING (n)))
SELECT * FROM T1;

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because you can't use aggregation with a self-reference.

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS (
    (SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM T1))
SELECT * FROM T1;

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because you can't use the window function `  OVER  ` clause with a self-reference.

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS (
    (SELECT 1.0 AS n) UNION ALL
    SELECT 1 + AVG(n) OVER(ROWS between 2 PRECEDING and 0 FOLLOWING) FROM T1 WHERE n < 10)
SELECT n FROM T1;

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because you can't use a `  LIMIT  ` clause with a self-reference.

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (SELECT n FROM T1 LIMIT 3))
SELECT * FROM T1;

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTEs are disallowed because you can't use an `  ORDER BY  ` clause with a self-reference.

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (SELECT n + 1 FROM T1 ORDER BY n))
SELECT * FROM T1;

-- Error
```

The following recursive CTE is disallowed because table `  T1  ` can't be recursively referenced from inside an inner `  WITH  ` clause

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  T1 AS ((SELECT 1 AS n) UNION ALL (WITH t AS (SELECT n FROM T1) SELECT * FROM t))
SELECT * FROM T1

-- Error
```

### CTE rules and constraints

Common table expressions (CTEs) can be referenced inside the query expression that contains the `  WITH  ` clause.

##### General rules

Here are some general rules and constraints to consider when working with CTEs:

  - Each CTE in the same `  WITH  ` clause must have a unique name.
  - You must include the [`  RECURSIVE  ` keyword](#recursive_keyword) keyword if the `  WITH  ` clause contains a recursive CTE.
  - The [`  RECURSIVE  ` keyword](#recursive_keyword) in the `  WITH  ` clause changes the visibility of CTEs to other CTEs in the same `  WITH  ` clause. You can learn more [here](#recursive_keyword) .
  - `  WITH  ` isn't allowed inside `  WITH RECURSIVE  ` .
  - `  WITH RECURSIVE  ` is allowed in the `  SELECT  ` statement.
  - `  WITH RECURSIVE  ` is only allowed at the top level of the query.
  - `  WITH RECURSIVE  ` isn't allowed in functions.
  - `  WITH RECURSIVE  ` isn't allowed in materialized views.
  - The `  WITH RECURSIVE  ` clause can't contain generative AI functions.
  - `  CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW  ` isn't supported. To work around this, use the `  WITH RECURSIVE  ` clause as the `  query_expression  ` in the `  CREATE VIEW  ` statement. For more information, see [CREATE VIEW](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_view_statement) .
  - A local CTE overrides an outer CTE or table with the same name.
  - A CTE on a subquery may not reference correlated columns from the outer query.

##### Base term rules

The following rules apply to the base term in a recursive CTE:

  - The base term is required to be non-recursive.
  - The base term determines the names and types of all of the table columns.

##### Recursive term rules

The following rules apply to the recursive term in a recursive CTE:

  - The recursive term must include exactly one reference to the recursively-defined table in the base term.
  - The recursive term must contain the same number of columns as the base term, and the type of each column must be implicitly coercible to the type of the corresponding column in the base term.
  - A recursive table reference can't be used as an operand to a `  FULL JOIN  ` , a right operand to a `  LEFT JOIN  ` , or a left operand to a `  RIGHT JOIN  ` .
  - A recursive table reference can't be used with the `  TABLESAMPLE  ` operator.
  - A recursive table reference can't be used as an operand to a table-valued function (TVF).
  - Use of the `  IN  ` and `  EXISTS  ` expression subqueries is limited within the recursive term. For example:
      - `  [NOT] IN  ` and `  [NOT] EXISTS  ` aren't allowed in the `  SELECT  ` clause.
      - `  NOT IN  ` isn't allowed in the `  WHERE  ` clause.

The following rules apply to a subquery inside a recursive term:

  - A subquery with a recursive table reference must be a `  SELECT  ` expression, not a set operation, such as `  UNION ALL  ` .
  - A subquery can't contain, directly or indirectly, a recursive table reference anywhere outside of its `  FROM  ` clause.
  - A subquery with a recursive table reference can't contain an `  ORDER BY  ` or `  LIMIT  ` clause.
  - A subquery with a recursive table reference can't invoke aggregate functions.
  - A subquery with a recursive table reference can't invoke window functions.
  - A subquery with a recursive table reference can't contain the `  DISTINCT  ` keyword or `  GROUP BY  ` clause.

### CTE visibility

The visibility of a common table expression (CTE) within a query expression is determined by whether or not you add the `  RECURSIVE  ` keyword to the `  WITH  ` clause where the CTE was defined. You can learn more about these differences in the following sections.

#### Visibility of CTEs in a `     WITH    ` clause with the `     RECURSIVE    ` keyword

When you include the `  RECURSIVE  ` keyword, references between CTEs in the `  WITH  ` clause can go backwards and forwards. Cycles aren't allowed.

This is what happens when you have two CTEs that reference themselves or each other in a `  WITH  ` clause with the `  RECURSIVE  ` keyword. Assume that `  A  ` is the first CTE and `  B  ` is the second CTE in the clause:

  - A references A = Valid
  - A references B = Valid
  - B references A = Valid
  - A references B references A = Invalid (cycles aren't allowed)

`  A  ` can reference itself because self-references are supported:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  A AS (SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL (SELECT n + 1 FROM A WHERE n < 3))
SELECT * FROM A

/*---+
 | n |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 | 2 |
 | 3 |
 +---*/
```

`  A  ` can reference `  B  ` because references between CTEs can go forwards:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  A AS (SELECT * FROM B),
  B AS (SELECT 1 AS n)
SELECT * FROM B

/*---+
 | n |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 +---*/
```

`  B  ` can reference `  A  ` because references between CTEs can go backwards:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  A AS (SELECT 1 AS n),
  B AS (SELECT * FROM A)
SELECT * FROM B

/*---+
 | n |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 +---*/
```

This produces an error. `  A  ` and `  B  ` reference each other, which creates a cycle:

``` text
WITH RECURSIVE
  A AS (SELECT * FROM B),
  B AS (SELECT * FROM A)
SELECT * FROM B

-- Error
```

#### Visibility of CTEs in a `     WITH    ` clause without the `     RECURSIVE    ` keyword

When you don't include the `  RECURSIVE  ` keyword in the `  WITH  ` clause, references between CTEs in the clause can go backward but not forward.

This is what happens when you have two CTEs that reference themselves or each other in a `  WITH  ` clause without the `  RECURSIVE  ` keyword. Assume that `  A  ` is the first CTE and `  B  ` is the second CTE in the clause:

  - A references A = Invalid
  - A references B = Invalid
  - B references A = Valid
  - A references B references A = Invalid (cycles aren't allowed)

This produces an error. `  A  ` can't reference itself because self-references aren't supported:

``` text
WITH
  A AS (SELECT 1 AS n UNION ALL (SELECT n + 1 FROM A WHERE n < 3))
SELECT * FROM A

-- Error
```

This produces an error. `  A  ` can't reference `  B  ` because references between CTEs can go backwards but not forwards:

``` text
WITH
  A AS (SELECT * FROM B),
  B AS (SELECT 1 AS n)
SELECT * FROM B

-- Error
```

`  B  ` can reference `  A  ` because references between CTEs can go backwards:

``` text
WITH
  A AS (SELECT 1 AS n),
  B AS (SELECT * FROM A)
SELECT * FROM B

/*---+
 | n |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 +---*/
```

This produces an error. `  A  ` and `  B  ` reference each other, which creates a cycle:

``` text
WITH
  A AS (SELECT * FROM B),
  B AS (SELECT * FROM A)
SELECT * FROM B

-- Error
```

## `     AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD    ` clause

Syntax for an aggregation threshold analysis rule–enforced query:

``` text
WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD OPTIONS (
  threshold = threshold_amount,
  privacy_unit_column = column_name
)
```

Syntax for an aggregation threshold analysis rule–enforced view:

``` text
WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD [ OPTIONS (
  [ threshold = threshold_amount ],
  [ privacy_unit_column = column_name ]
) ]
```

**Description**

Use the `  AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD  ` clause to enforce an aggregation threshold. This clause counts the number of distinct privacy units (represented by the privacy unit column) for each group, and only outputs the groups where the distinct privacy unit count satisfies the aggregation threshold. If you want to use an aggregation threshold analysis rule that you defined for a view, use the syntax for an [analysis rule–enforced view](/bigquery/docs/analysis-rules#privacy_view) . When querying a privacy-enforced view, the `  AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD  ` clause does not need to include the `  OPTIONS  ` clause.

**Definitions:**

  - `  threshold  ` : The minimum number of distinct privacy units (privacy unit column values) that need to contribute to each row in the query results. If a potential row doesn't satisfy this threshold, that row is omitted from the query results. `  threshold_amount  ` must be a positive `  INT64  ` value.
    
    If you're using this query with an analysis rule–enforced view, you can optionally add this query parameter to override the `  threshold  ` parameter for the view. The threshold for the query must be equal to or greater than the threshold for the view. If the threshold for the query is less than the threshold for the view, an error is produced.

  - `  privacy_unit_column  ` : The column that represents the privacy unit column. Replace `  column_name  ` with the path expression for the column. The first identifier in the path can start with either a table name or a column name that's visible in the `  FROM  ` clause.
    
    If you're using this query with an analysis rule–enforced view, you can optionally add this query parameter. However, it must match the value for `  privacy_unit_column  ` on the view. If it doesn't, an error is produced.

**Details**

The following functions can be used on any column in a query with the `  AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD  ` clause, including the commonly used `  COUNT  ` , `  SUM  ` , and `  AVG  ` functions:

  - `  APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT  `
  - `  AVG  `
  - `  COUNT  `
  - `  COUNTIF  `
  - `  LOGICAL_AND  `
  - `  LOGICAL_OR  `
  - `  SUM  `
  - `  COVAR_POP  `
  - `  COVAR_SAMP  `
  - `  STDDEV_POP  `
  - `  STDDEV_SAMP  `
  - `  VAR_POP  `
  - `  VAR_SAMP  `

**Example**

In the following example, an aggregation threshold is enforced on a query. Notice that some privacy units are dropped because there aren't enough distinct instances.

``` text
WITH ExamTable AS (
  SELECT "Hansen" AS last_name, "P91" AS test_id, 510 AS test_score UNION ALL
  SELECT "Wang", "U25", 500 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Wang", "C83", 520 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Wang", "U25", 460 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Hansen", "C83", 420 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Hansen", "C83", 560 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Devi", "U25", 580 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Devi", "P91", 480 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Ivanov", "U25", 490 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Ivanov", "P91", 540 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Silva", "U25", 550)
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  OPTIONS(threshold=3, privacy_unit_column=last_name)
  test_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) AS student_count,
  AVG(test_score) AS avg_test_score
FROM ExamTable
GROUP BY test_id;

/*---------+---------------+----------------+
 | test_id | student_count | avg_test_score |
 +---------+---------------+----------------+
 | P91     | 3             | 510.0          |
 | U25     | 4             | 516.0          |
 +---------+---------------+----------------*/
```

In the following example, an aggregation threshold analysis rule is enforced on a view with the same results:

``` text
-- Create a table.
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE mydataset.ExamTable AS (
  SELECT "Hansen" AS last_name, "P91" AS test_id, 510 AS test_score UNION ALL
  SELECT "Wang", "U25", 500 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Wang", "C83", 520 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Wang", "U25", 460 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Hansen", "C83", 420 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Hansen", "C83", 560 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Devi", "U25", 580 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Devi", "P91", 480 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Ivanov", "U25", 490 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Ivanov", "P91", 540 UNION ALL
  SELECT "Silva", "U25", 550);

-- Create a view for the table.
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW mydataset.ExamView
OPTIONS(
  privacy_policy= '{"aggregation_threshold_policy": {"threshold": 3, "privacy_unit_column": "last_name"}}'
)
AS ( SELECT * FROM mydataset.ExamTable );

-- Query the aggregation threshold privacy-policy enforced view.
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  test_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) AS student_count,
  AVG(test_score) AS avg_test_score
FROM mydataset.ExamView
GROUP BY test_id;

/*---------+---------------+----------------+
 | test_id | student_count | avg_test_score |
 +---------+---------------+----------------+
 | P91     | 3             | 510.0          |
 | U25     | 4             | 516.0          |
 +---------+---------------+----------------*/
```

In the following example, an aggregation threshold analysis rule is enforced on the previous view, but the threshold is adjusted from `  3  ` in the view to `  4  ` in the query:

``` text
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  OPTIONS(threshold=4)
  test_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) AS student_count,
  AVG(test_score) AS avg_test_score
FROM mydataset.ExamView
GROUP BY test_id;

/*---------+---------------+----------------+
 | test_id | student_count | avg_test_score |
 +---------+---------------+----------------+
 | U25     | 4             | 516.0          |
 +---------+---------------+----------------*/
```

In the following example, an aggregation threshold analysis rule is enforced on the previous view, but the threshold is adjusted from `  3  ` in the view to `  5  ` in the query. While the analysis rule is satisfied, the query produces no data.

``` text
-- No data is produced.
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  OPTIONS(threshold=5)
  test_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) AS student_count,
  AVG(test_score) AS avg_test_score
FROM mydataset.ExamView
GROUP BY test_id;
```

In the following example, an aggregation threshold analysis rule is enforced on the previous view, but the threshold is adjusted from `  3  ` in the view to `  2  ` in the query:

``` text
-- Error: Aggregation threshold is too low.
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  OPTIONS(threshold=2)
  test_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) AS student_count,
  AVG(test_score) AS avg_test_score
FROM mydataset.ExamView
GROUP BY test_id;
```

In the following example, an aggregation threshold analysis rule is enforced on the previous view, but the threshold is adjusted from `  last_name  ` in the view to `  test_id  ` in the query:

``` text
-- Error: Can't override the privacy unit column set in view.
SELECT WITH AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD
  OPTIONS(privacy_unit_column=test_id)
  test_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT last_name) AS student_count,
  AVG(test_score) AS avg_test_score
FROM mydataset.ExamView
GROUP BY test_id;
```

## Differential privacy clause

``` text
WITH DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY OPTIONS( privacy_parameters )

privacy_parameters:
  epsilon = expression,
  delta = expression,
  [ max_groups_contributed = expression ],
  privacy_unit_column = column_name
```

**Description**

This clause lets you transform the results of a query with [differentially private aggregations](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate-dp-functions) . To learn more about differential privacy, see [Differential privacy](/bigquery/docs/differential-privacy) .

You can use the following syntax to build a differential privacy clause:

  - [`  epsilon  `](#dp_epsilon) : Controls the amount of noise added to the results. A higher epsilon means less noise. `  expression  ` must be a literal and return a `  FLOAT64  ` .
  - [`  delta  `](#dp_delta) : The probability that any row in the result fails to be epsilon-differentially private. `  expression  ` must be a literal and return a `  FLOAT64  ` .
  - [`  max_groups_contributed  `](#dp_max_groups) : A positive integer identifying the limit on the number of groups that an entity is allowed to contribute to. This number is also used to scale the noise for each group. `  expression  ` must be a literal and return an `  INT64  ` .
  - [`  privacy_unit_column  `](#dp_privacy_unit_id) : The column that represents the privacy unit column. Replace `  column_name  ` with the path expression for the column. The first identifier in the path can start with either a table name or a column name that's visible in the `  FROM  ` clause.

If you want to use this syntax, add it after the `  SELECT  ` keyword with one or more differentially private aggregate functions in the `  SELECT  ` list. To learn more about the privacy parameters in this syntax, see [Privacy parameters](#dp_privacy_parameters) .

### Privacy parameters

Privacy parameters control how the results of a query are transformed. Appropriate values for these settings can depend on many things such as the characteristics of your data, the exposure level, and the privacy level.

In this section, you can learn more about how you can use privacy parameters to control how the results are transformed.

#### `     epsilon    `

Noise is added primarily based on the specified `  epsilon  ` differential privacy parameter. The higher the epsilon the less noise is added. More noise corresponding to smaller epsilons equals more privacy protection.

Noise can be eliminated by setting `  epsilon  ` to `  1e20  ` , which can be useful during initial data exploration and experimentation with differential privacy. Extremely large `  epsilon  ` values, such as `  1e308  ` , cause query failure.

GoogleSQL splits `  epsilon  ` between the differentially private aggregates in the query. In addition to the explicit differentially private aggregate functions, the differential privacy process also injects an implicit differentially private aggregate into the plan for removing small groups that computes a noisy entity count per group. If you have `  n  ` explicit differentially private aggregate functions in your query, then each aggregate individually gets `  epsilon/(n+1)  ` for its computation. If used with `  max_groups_contributed  ` , the effective `  epsilon  ` per function per groups is further split by `  max_groups_contributed  ` . Additionally, if implicit clamping is used for an aggregate differentially private function, then half of the function's epsilon is applied towards computing implicit bounds, and half of the function's epsilon is applied towards the differentially private aggregation itself.

#### `     delta    `

The `  delta  ` differential privacy parameter represents the probability that any row fails to be `  epsilon  ` -differentially private in the result of a differentially private query.

#### `     max_groups_contributed    `

The `  max_groups_contributed  ` differential privacy parameter is a positive integer that, if specified, scales the noise and limits the number of groups that each entity can contribute to.

`  max_groups_contributed  ` is set by default, even if you don't specify it. The default value is `  1  ` . If `  max_groups_contributed  ` is set to `  NULL  ` , then `  max_groups_contributed  ` is unspecified and there is no limit to the number of groups that each entity can contribute to.

If `  max_groups_contributed  ` is unspecified, the language can't guarantee that the results will be differentially private. We recommend that you specify `  max_groups_contributed  ` . If you don't specify `  max_groups_contributed  ` , the results might still be differentially private if certain preconditions are met. For example, if you know that the privacy unit column in a table or view is unique in the `  FROM  ` clause, the entity can't contribute to more than one group and therefore the results will be the same regardless of whether `  max_groups_contributed  ` is set.

#### `     privacy_unit_column    `

To learn about the privacy unit and how to define a privacy unit column, see [Define a privacy unit column](/bigquery/docs/differential-privacy#dp_define_privacy_unit_id) .

### Differential privacy examples

This section contains examples that illustrate how to work with differential privacy in GoogleSQL.

#### Tables for examples

The examples in this section reference the following tables:

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE professors AS (
  SELECT 101 AS id, "pencil" AS item, 24 AS quantity UNION ALL
  SELECT 123, "pen", 16 UNION ALL
  SELECT 123, "pencil", 10 UNION ALL
  SELECT 123, "pencil", 38 UNION ALL
  SELECT 101, "pen", 19 UNION ALL
  SELECT 101, "pen", 23 UNION ALL
  SELECT 130, "scissors", 8 UNION ALL
  SELECT 150, "pencil", 72);
```

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE students AS (
  SELECT 1 AS id, "pencil" AS item, 5 AS quantity UNION ALL
  SELECT 1, "pen", 2 UNION ALL
  SELECT 2, "pen", 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT 3, "pen", 4);
```

#### Add noise

You can add noise to a differentially private query. Smaller groups might not be included. Smaller epsilons and more noise will provide greater privacy protection.

``` text
-- This gets the average number of items requested per professor and adds
-- noise to the results
SELECT
  WITH DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY
    OPTIONS(epsilon=10, delta=.01, max_groups_contributed=2, privacy_unit_column=id)
    item,
    AVG(quantity, contribution_bounds_per_group => (0,100)) AS average_quantity
FROM professors
GROUP BY item;

-- These results will change each time you run the query.
-- The scissors group was removed this time, but might not be
-- removed the next time.
/*----------+------------------+
 | item     | average_quantity |
 +----------+------------------+
 | pencil   | 38.5038356810269 |
 | pen      | 13.4725028762032 |
 +----------+------------------*/
```

#### Remove noise

Removing noise removes privacy protection. Only remove noise for testing queries on non-private data. When `  epsilon  ` is high, noise is removed from the results.

``` text
-- This gets the average number of items requested per professor and removes
-- noise from the results
SELECT
  WITH DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY
    OPTIONS(epsilon=1e20, delta=.01, max_groups_contributed=2, privacy_unit_column=id)
    item,
    AVG(quantity, contribution_bounds_per_group => (0,100)) AS average_quantity
FROM professors
GROUP BY item;

/*----------+------------------+
 | item     | average_quantity |
 +----------+------------------+
 | pencil   | 40               |

#### Limit the groups in which a privacy unit ID can exist

A privacy unit column can exist within multiple groups. For example, in the `  professors  ` table, the privacy unit column `  123  ` exists in the `  pencil  ` and `  pen  ` group. You can set `  max_groups_contributed  ` to different values to limit how many groups each privacy unit column will be included in.

``` text
SELECT
  WITH DIFFERENTIAL_PRIVACY
    OPTIONS(epsilon=1e20, delta=.01, privacy_unit_column=id)
    item,
    AVG(quantity, contribution_bounds_per_group => (0,100)) AS average_quantity
FROM professors
GROUP BY item;

-- The privacy unit column 123 was only included in the pen group in this example.
-- Noise was removed from this query for demonstration purposes only.
/*----------+------------------+
 | item     | average_quantity |
 +----------+------------------+
 | pencil   | 40               |
 | pen      | 18.5             |
 | scissors | 8                |

## Using aliases

An alias is a temporary name given to a table, column, or expression present in a query. You can introduce explicit aliases in the `  SELECT  ` list or `  FROM  ` clause, or GoogleSQL infers an implicit alias for some expressions. Expressions with neither an explicit nor implicit alias are anonymous and the query can't reference them by name.

### Explicit aliases

You can introduce explicit aliases in either the `  FROM  ` clause or the `  SELECT  ` list.

In a `  FROM  ` clause, you can introduce explicit aliases for any item, including tables, arrays, subqueries, and `  UNNEST  ` clauses, using `  [AS] alias  ` . The `  AS  ` keyword is optional.

Example:

``` text
SELECT s.FirstName, s2.SongName
FROM Singers AS s, (SELECT * FROM Songs) AS s2;
```

You can introduce explicit aliases for any expression in the `  SELECT  ` list using `  [AS] alias  ` . The `  AS  ` keyword is optional.

Example:

``` text
SELECT s.FirstName AS name, LOWER(s.FirstName) AS lname
FROM Singers s;
```

### Implicit aliases

In the `  SELECT  ` list, if there is an expression that doesn't have an explicit alias, GoogleSQL assigns an implicit alias according to the following rules. There can be multiple columns with the same alias in the `  SELECT  ` list.

  - For identifiers, the alias is the identifier. For example, `  SELECT abc  ` implies `  AS abc  ` .
  - For path expressions, the alias is the last identifier in the path. For example, `  SELECT abc.def.ghi  ` implies `  AS ghi  ` .
  - For field access using the "dot" member field access operator, the alias is the field name. For example, `  SELECT (struct_function()).fname  ` implies `  AS fname  ` .

In all other cases, there is no implicit alias, so the column is anonymous and can't be referenced by name. The data from that column will still be returned and the displayed query results may have a generated label for that column, but the label can't be used like an alias.

In a `  FROM  ` clause, `  from_item  ` s aren't required to have an alias. The following rules apply:

  - If there is an expression that doesn't have an explicit alias, GoogleSQL assigns an implicit alias in these cases:
      - For identifiers, the alias is the identifier. For example, `  FROM abc  ` implies `  AS abc  ` .
      - For path expressions, the alias is the last identifier in the path. For example, `  FROM abc.def.ghi  ` implies `  AS ghi  `
      - The column produced using `  WITH OFFSET  ` has the implicit alias `  offset  ` .
  - Table subqueries don't have implicit aliases.
  - `  FROM UNNEST(x)  ` doesn't have an implicit alias.

### Alias visibility

After you introduce an explicit alias in a query, there are restrictions on where else in the query you can reference that alias. These restrictions on alias visibility are the result of GoogleSQL name scoping rules.

#### Visibility in the `     FROM    ` clause

GoogleSQL processes aliases in a `  FROM  ` clause from left to right, and aliases are visible only to subsequent path expressions in a `  FROM  ` clause.

Example:

Assume the `  Singers  ` table had a `  Concerts  ` column of `  ARRAY  ` type.

``` text
SELECT FirstName
FROM Singers AS s, s.Concerts;
```

Invalid:

``` text
SELECT FirstName
FROM s.Concerts, Singers AS s;  // INVALID.
```

`  FROM  ` clause aliases are **not** visible to subqueries in the same `  FROM  ` clause. Subqueries in a `  FROM  ` clause can't contain correlated references to other tables in the same `  FROM  ` clause.

Invalid:

``` text
SELECT FirstName
FROM Singers AS s, (SELECT (2020 - ReleaseDate) FROM s)  // INVALID.
```

You can use any column name from a table in the `  FROM  ` as an alias anywhere in the query, with or without qualification with the table name.

Example:

``` text
SELECT FirstName, s.ReleaseDate
FROM Singers s WHERE ReleaseDate = 1975;
```

If the `  FROM  ` clause contains an explicit alias, you must use the explicit alias instead of the implicit alias for the remainder of the query (see [Implicit Aliases](#implicit_aliases) ). A table alias is useful for brevity or to eliminate ambiguity in cases such as self-joins, where the same table is scanned multiple times during query processing.

Example:

``` text
SELECT * FROM Singers as s, Songs as s2
ORDER BY s.LastName
```

Invalid — `  ORDER BY  ` doesn't use the table alias:

``` text
SELECT * FROM Singers as s, Songs as s2
ORDER BY Singers.LastName;  // INVALID.
```

#### Visibility in the `     SELECT    ` list

Aliases in the `  SELECT  ` list are visible only to the following clauses:

  - `  GROUP BY  ` clause
  - `  ORDER BY  ` clause
  - `  HAVING  ` clause

Example:

``` text
SELECT LastName AS last, SingerID
FROM Singers
ORDER BY last;
```

#### Visibility in the `     GROUP BY    ` , `     ORDER BY    ` , and `     HAVING    ` clauses

These three clauses, `  GROUP BY  ` , `  ORDER BY  ` , and `  HAVING  ` , can refer to only the following values:

  - Tables in the `  FROM  ` clause and any of their columns.
  - Aliases from the `  SELECT  ` list.

`  GROUP BY  ` and `  ORDER BY  ` can also refer to a third group:

  - Integer literals, which refer to items in the `  SELECT  ` list. The integer `  1  ` refers to the first item in the `  SELECT  ` list, `  2  ` refers to the second item, etc.

Example:

``` text
SELECT SingerID AS sid, COUNT(Songid) AS s2id
FROM Songs
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

The previous query is equivalent to:

``` text
SELECT SingerID AS sid, COUNT(Songid) AS s2id
FROM Songs
GROUP BY sid
ORDER BY s2id DESC;
```

### Duplicate aliases

A `  SELECT  ` list or subquery containing multiple explicit or implicit aliases of the same name is allowed, as long as the alias name isn't referenced elsewhere in the query, since the reference would be [ambiguous](#ambiguous_aliases) .

When a top-level `  SELECT  ` list contains duplicate column names and no destination table is specified, all duplicate columns, except for the first one, are automatically renamed to make them unique. The renamed columns appear in the query result.

Example:

``` text
SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS a;

/*---+-----+
 | a | a_1 |
 +---+-----+
 | 1 | 2   |
 +---+-----*/
```

Duplicate column names in a table or view definition aren't supported. These statements with queries that contain duplicate column names will fail:

``` text
-- This query fails.
CREATE TABLE my_dataset.my_table AS (SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS a);
```

``` text
-- This query fails.
CREATE VIEW my_dataset.my_view AS (SELECT 1 AS a, 2 AS a);
```

### Ambiguous aliases

GoogleSQL provides an error if accessing a name is ambiguous, meaning it can resolve to more than one unique object in the query or in a table schema, including the schema of a destination table.

The following query contains column names that conflict between tables, since both `  Singers  ` and `  Songs  ` have a column named `  SingerID  ` :

``` text
SELECT SingerID
FROM Singers, Songs;
```

The following query contains aliases that are ambiguous in the `  GROUP BY  ` clause because they are duplicated in the `  SELECT  ` list:

``` text
SELECT FirstName AS name, LastName AS name,
FROM Singers
GROUP BY name;
```

The following query contains aliases that are ambiguous in the `  SELECT  ` list and `  FROM  ` clause because they share a column and field with same name.

  - Assume the `  Person  ` table has three columns: `  FirstName  ` , `  LastName  ` , and `  PrimaryContact  ` .
  - Assume the `  PrimaryContact  ` column represents a struct with these fields: `  FirstName  ` and `  LastName  ` .

The alias `  P  ` is ambiguous and will produce an error because `  P.FirstName  ` in the `  GROUP BY  ` clause could refer to either `  Person.FirstName  ` or `  Person.PrimaryContact.FirstName  ` .

``` text
SELECT FirstName, LastName, PrimaryContact AS P
FROM Person AS P
GROUP BY P.FirstName;
```

A name is *not* ambiguous in `  GROUP BY  ` , `  ORDER BY  ` or `  HAVING  ` if it's both a column name and a `  SELECT  ` list alias, as long as the name resolves to the same underlying object. In the following example, the alias `  BirthYear  ` isn't ambiguous because it resolves to the same underlying column, `  Singers.BirthYear  ` .

``` text
SELECT LastName, BirthYear AS BirthYear
FROM Singers
GROUP BY BirthYear;
```

### Range variables

In GoogleSQL, a range variable is a table expression alias in the `  FROM  ` clause. Sometimes a range variable is known as a `  table alias  ` . A range variable lets you reference rows being scanned from a table expression. A table expression represents an item in the `  FROM  ` clause that returns a table. Common items that this expression can represent include tables, [value tables](#value_tables) , [subqueries](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries) , [table-valued functions (TVFs)](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/table-functions) , [joins](#join_types) , and [parenthesized joins](#join_types) .

In general, a range variable provides a reference to the rows of a table expression. A range variable can be used to qualify a column reference and unambiguously identify the related table, for example `  range_variable.column_1  ` .

When referencing a range variable on its own without a specified column suffix, the result of a table expression is the row type of the related table. Value tables have explicit row types, so for range variables related to value tables, the result type is the value table's row type. Other tables don't have explicit row types, and for those tables, the range variable type is a dynamically defined struct that includes all of the columns in the table.

**Examples**

In these examples, the `  WITH  ` clause is used to emulate a temporary table called `  Grid  ` . This table has columns `  x  ` and `  y  ` . A range variable called `  Coordinate  ` refers to the current row as the table is scanned. `  Coordinate  ` can be used to access the entire row or columns in the row.

The following example selects column `  x  ` from range variable `  Coordinate  ` , which in effect selects column `  x  ` from table `  Grid  ` .

``` text
WITH Grid AS (SELECT 1 x, 2 y)
SELECT Coordinate.x FROM Grid AS Coordinate;

/*---+
 | x |
 +---+
 | 1 |
 +---*/
```

The following example selects all columns from range variable `  Coordinate  ` , which in effect selects all columns from table `  Grid  ` .

``` text
WITH Grid AS (SELECT 1 x, 2 y)
SELECT Coordinate.* FROM Grid AS Coordinate;

/*---+---+
 | x | y |
 +---+---+
 | 1 | 2 |
 +---+---*/
```

The following example selects the range variable `  Coordinate  ` , which is a reference to rows in table `  Grid  ` . Since `  Grid  ` isn't a value table, the result type of `  Coordinate  ` is a struct that contains all the columns from `  Grid  ` .

``` text
WITH Grid AS (SELECT 1 x, 2 y)
SELECT Coordinate FROM Grid AS Coordinate;

/*--------------+
 | Coordinate   |
 +--------------+
 | {x: 1, y: 2} |
 +--------------*/
```

## Value tables

In addition to standard SQL *tables* , GoogleSQL supports *value tables* . In a value table, rather than having rows made up of a list of columns, each row is a single value of type `  STRUCT  ` , and there are no column names.

In the following example, a value table for a `  STRUCT  ` is produced with the `  SELECT AS VALUE  ` statement:

``` text
SELECT * FROM (SELECT AS VALUE STRUCT(123 AS a, FALSE AS b))

/*-----+-------+
 | a   | b     |
 +-----+-------+
 | 123 | FALSE |
 +-----+-------*/
```

### Return query results as a value table

You can use GoogleSQL to return query results as a value table. This is useful when you want to store a query result with a `  STRUCT  ` type as a table. To return a query result as a value table, use one of the following statements:

  - [`  SELECT AS STRUCT  `](#select_list)
  - [`  SELECT AS VALUE  `](#select_list)

Value tables can also occur as the output of the [`  UNNEST  `](#unnest_operator) operator or a [subquery](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries) . The [`  WITH  ` clause](#with_clause) introduces a value table if the subquery used produces a value table.

In contexts where a query with exactly one column is expected, a value table query can be used instead. For example, scalar and array [subqueries](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/subqueries) normally require a single-column query, but in GoogleSQL, they also allow using a value table query.

### Create a table with a value table

Value tables aren't supported as top-level queries in the `  CREATE TABLE  ` statement, but they can be included in subqueries and `  UNNEST  ` operations. For example, you can create a table from a value table with this query:

``` text
CREATE TABLE Reviews AS
SELECT * FROM (SELECT AS VALUE STRUCT(5 AS star_rating, FALSE AS up_down_rating))
```

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Column Name</th>
<th>Data Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>star_rating</td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       INT64      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>up_down_rating</td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       BOOL      </code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Use a set operation on a value table

You can't combine tables and value tables in a `  SET  ` operation.

## Table function calls

To call a TVF, use the function call in place of the table name in a `  FROM  ` clause.

## Appendix A: examples with sample data

These examples include statements which perform queries on the [`  Roster  `](#roster_table) and [`  TeamMascot  `](#teammascot_table) , and [`  PlayerStats  `](#playerstats_table) tables.

### Sample tables

The following tables are used to illustrate the behavior of different query clauses in this reference.

#### Roster table

The `  Roster  ` table includes a list of player names ( `  LastName  ` ) and the unique ID assigned to their school ( `  SchoolID  ` ). It looks like this:

``` text
/*-----------------------+
 | LastName   | SchoolID |
 +-----------------------+
 | Adams      | 50       |
 | Buchanan   | 52       |
 | Coolidge   | 52       |
 | Davis      | 51       |
 | Eisenhower | 77       |
 +-----------------------*/
```

You can use this `  WITH  ` clause to emulate a temporary table name for the examples in this reference:

``` text
WITH Roster AS
 (SELECT 'Adams' as LastName, 50 as SchoolID UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 52 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Coolidge', 52 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Davis', 51 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Eisenhower', 77)
SELECT * FROM Roster
```

#### PlayerStats table

The `  PlayerStats  ` table includes a list of player names ( `  LastName  ` ) and the unique ID assigned to the opponent they played in a given game ( `  OpponentID  ` ) and the number of points scored by the athlete in that game ( `  PointsScored  ` ).

``` text
/*----------------------------------------+
 | LastName   | OpponentID | PointsScored |
 +----------------------------------------+
 | Adams      | 51         | 3            |
 | Buchanan   | 77         | 0            |
 | Coolidge   | 77         | 1            |
 | Adams      | 52         | 4            |
 | Buchanan   | 50         | 13           |
 +----------------------------------------*/
```

You can use this `  WITH  ` clause to emulate a temporary table name for the examples in this reference:

``` text
WITH PlayerStats AS
 (SELECT 'Adams' as LastName, 51 as OpponentID, 3 as PointsScored UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 77, 0 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Coolidge', 77, 1 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Adams', 52, 4 UNION ALL
  SELECT 'Buchanan', 50, 13)
SELECT * FROM PlayerStats
```

#### TeamMascot table

The `  TeamMascot  ` table includes a list of unique school IDs ( `  SchoolID  ` ) and the mascot for that school ( `  Mascot  ` ).

``` text
/*---------------------+
 | SchoolID | Mascot   |
 +---------------------+
 | 50       | Jaguars  |
 | 51       | Knights  |
 | 52       | Lakers   |
 | 53       | Mustangs |
 +---------------------*/
```

You can use this `  WITH  ` clause to emulate a temporary table name for the examples in this reference:

``` text
WITH TeamMascot AS
 (SELECT 50 as SchoolID, 'Jaguars' as Mascot UNION ALL
  SELECT 51, 'Knights' UNION ALL
  SELECT 52, 'Lakers' UNION ALL
  SELECT 53, 'Mustangs')
SELECT * FROM TeamMascot
```

### `     GROUP BY    ` clause

Example:

``` text
SELECT LastName, SUM(PointsScored)
FROM PlayerStats
GROUP BY LastName;
```

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>LastName</th>
<th>SUM</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Adams</td>
<td>7</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Buchanan</td>
<td>13</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Coolidge</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### `     UNION    `

The `  UNION  ` operator combines the result sets of two or more `  SELECT  ` statements by pairing columns from the result set of each `  SELECT  ` statement and vertically concatenating them.

Example:

``` text
SELECT Mascot AS X, SchoolID AS Y
FROM TeamMascot
UNION ALL
SELECT LastName, PointsScored
FROM PlayerStats;
```

Results:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>X</th>
<th>Y</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Jaguars</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Knights</td>
<td>51</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Lakers</td>
<td>52</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Mustangs</td>
<td>53</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Adams</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Buchanan</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Coolidge</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Adams</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Buchanan</td>
<td>13</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### `     INTERSECT    `

This query returns the last names that are present in both Roster and PlayerStats.

``` text
SELECT LastName
FROM Roster
INTERSECT DISTINCT
SELECT LastName
FROM PlayerStats;
```

Results:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>LastName</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Adams</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Coolidge</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Buchanan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### `     EXCEPT    `

The query below returns last names in Roster that are **not** present in PlayerStats.

``` text
SELECT LastName
FROM Roster
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT LastName
FROM PlayerStats;
```

Results:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>LastName</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Eisenhower</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Davis</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Reversing the order of the `  SELECT  ` statements will return last names in PlayerStats that are **not** present in Roster:

``` text
SELECT LastName
FROM PlayerStats
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT LastName
FROM Roster;
```

Results:

``` text
(empty)
```
