# The CREATE MODEL statement for generalized linear models

This document describes the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement for creating [linear regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression) or [logistic regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/logistic-regression) models in BigQuery by using SQL. Alternatively, you can use the Google Cloud console user interface to [create a model by using a UI](/bigquery/docs/create-machine-learning-model-console) ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ) instead of constructing the SQL statement yourself.

You can use linear regression models with the [`  ML.PREDICT  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-predict) to perform [regression](/bigquery/docs/regression-overview) , and you can use logistic regression models with the `  ML.PREDICT  ` function to perform [classification](/bigquery/docs/classification-overview) . You can use both linear and logistic regression models with the `  ML.PREDICT  ` function to perform [anomaly detection](/bigquery/docs/anomaly-detection-overview) .

For more information about supported SQL statements and functions for this model, see [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey) .

### `     CREATE MODEL    `

Creates and trains a new model in the specified dataset. If the model name exists, `  CREATE MODEL  ` returns an error.

### `     CREATE MODEL IF NOT EXISTS    `

Creates and trains a new model only if the model doesn't exist in the specified dataset.

### `     CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL    `

Creates and trains a model and replaces an existing model with the same name in the specified dataset.

### `     model_name    `

The name of the model you're creating or replacing. The model name must be unique in the dataset: no other model or table can have the same name. The model name must follow the same naming rules as a BigQuery table. A model name can:

  - Contain up to 1,024 characters
  - Contain letters (upper or lower case), numbers, and underscores

`  model_name  ` is case-sensitive.

If you don't have a default project configured, then you must prepend the project ID to the model name in the following format, including backticks:

\`\[PROJECT\_ID\].\[DATASET\].\[MODEL\]\`

For example, \`myproject.mydataset.mymodel\`.

### `     MODEL_TYPE    `

**Syntax**

``` text
MODEL_TYPE = { 'LINEAR_REG' | 'LOGISTIC_REG'}
```

**Description**

Specify the model type. This option is required.

**Arguments**

This option accepts the following values:

  - `  LINEAR_REG  ` : The model performs linear regression for forecasting; for example, the sales of an item on a given day. Labels are real-valued. They can't be +/- infinity or `  NaN  ` .

  - `  LOGISTIC_REG  ` : The model performs logistic regression for classification; for example, determining whether a customer will make a purchase.
    
    Logistic models can be one of two types:
    
      - Binary logistic regression for classification; for example, determining whether a customer will make a purchase. Labels must only have two possible values, one for the [positive class](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/?&_ga=2.199267948.315885954.1628494155-266466322.1625885991#positive-class) and another for the [negative class](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/?&_ga=2.199267948.315885954.1628494155-266466322.1625885991#negative-class) . BigQuery ML treats the higher label value as the positive class, and lower label value as the negative class. This holds for both numeric and string label values.
      - Multiclass logistic regression for classification; for example, predicting multiple possible values such as whether an input is `  low-value  ` , `  medium-value  ` , or `  high-value  ` . Labels can have up to 50 unique values. In BigQuery ML, multiclass logistic regression training uses a [multinomial classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression) with a [cross entropy loss function](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#cross-entropy) .

### `     OPTIMIZE_STRATEGY    `

**Syntax**

OPTIMIZE_STRATEGY = { 'AUTO_STRATEGY' | 'BATCH_GRADIENT_DESCENT' | 'NORMAL_EQUATION' }
```

**Description**

The strategy to train linear regression models.

**Arguments**

This option accepts the following values:

  - `  AUTO_STRATEGY  ` : This is the default. Determines the training strategy as follows:
    
      - If you specified a value for `  L1_REG  ` or set `  WARM_START  ` to `  TRUE  ` , the `  BATCH_GRADIENT_DESCENT  ` strategy is used.
      - If the total cardinality of training features is more than 10,000, the `  BATCH_GRADIENT_DESCENT  ` strategy is used.
      - If there is an over-fitting issue, where the number of training examples is less than 10 *x* and *x* is the total cardinality, the `  BATCH_GRADIENT_DESCENT  ` strategy is used.
      - The `  NORMAL_EQUATION  ` strategy is used for all other cases.

  - `  BATCH_GRADIENT_DESCENT  ` : Train the model using the [batch gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) method, which optimizes the loss function using the gradient function.

  - `  NORMAL_EQUATION  ` : Directly compute the [least square solution](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalEquation.html) of the linear regression problem with the analytical formula. You can't use `  NORMAL_EQUATION  ` in the following cases:
    
      - You specified a value for `  L1_REG  ` .
      - You set `  WARM_START  ` to `  TRUE  ` .
      - The total cardinality of training features is greater than 10,000.

### `     LEARN_RATE_STRATEGY    `

**Syntax**

``` text
LEARN_RATE_STRATEGY = { 'LINE_SEARCH' | 'CONSTANT' }
```

**Description**

The strategy for specifying the [learning rate](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#learning_rate) during training.

**Arguments**

This option accepts the following values:

  - `  LINE_SEARCH  ` : This is the default. Use the [line search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_search) method to calculate the learning rate. You specify the line search initial learn rate in [`  LS_INIT_LEARN_RATE  `](#ls_init_learn_rate) .
    
    Line search slows down training and increases the number of bytes processed, but it generally converges even with a larger initial specified learning rate.

  - `  CONSTANT  ` : Set the learning rate to the value you specify in [`  LEARN_RATE  `](#learn_rate) .

### `     LEARN_RATE    `

**Syntax**

`  LEARN_RATE = float64_value  `

**Description**

The learn rate for [gradient descent](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#gradient_descent) when [`  LEARN_RATE_STRATEGY  `](#learn_rate_strategy) is set to `  CONSTANT  ` . If `  LEARN_RATE_STRATEGY  ` is set to `  LINE_SEARCH  ` , an error is returned.

**Arguments**

A `  FLOAT64  ` value. The default value is `  0.1  ` .

### `     LS_INIT_LEARN_RATE    `

**Syntax**

`  LS_INIT_LEARN_RATE = float64_value  `

**Description**

Sets the initial learning rate when you specify `  LINE_SEARCH  ` for [`  LEARN_RATE_STRATEGY  `](#learn_rate_strategy) .

If the model learning rate appears to be doubling every iteration as indicated by the [`  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-train) , then try setting `  LS_INIT_LEARN_RATE  ` to the last doubled learning rate. The optimal initial learning rate is different for every model. A good initial learning rate for one model might not be a good initial learning rate for another.

**Arguments**

A `  FLOAT64  ` value. The default value is `  0.1  ` .

### `     CALCULATE_P_VALUES    `

**Syntax**

`  CALCULATE_P_VALUES = { TRUE | FALSE }  `

**Description**

Determines whether to compute p-values and standard errors during training.

P-values and standard errors are computed when you create the model. This option must be `  TRUE  ` if you want to use the [`  ML.ADVANCED_WEIGHTS  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-advanced-weights) to retrieve the p-values and standard errors after the model finishes training. For more information on the usage requirements for `  ML.ADVANCED_WEIGHTS  ` , see [Usage requirements](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-advanced-weights#usage_requirements) .

**Arguments**

A `  BOOL  ` value. The default value is `  FALSE  ` .

### `     FIT_INTERCEPT    `

**Syntax**

``` text
FIT_INTERCEPT = { TRUE | FALSE }
```

**Description**

Determines whether to fit an intercept to the model during training.

**Arguments**

A `  BOOL  ` value. The default value is `  TRUE  ` .

### `     CATEGORY_ENCODING_METHOD    `

**Syntax**

``` text
CATEGORY_ENCODING_METHOD = { 'ONE_HOT_ENCODING' | 'DUMMY_ENCODING' }
```

**Description**

Specifies which encoding method to use on non-numeric features. For more information about supported encoding methods, see [Automatic feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/auto-preprocessing) .

**Arguments**

This option accepts the following values:

  - `  ONE_HOT_ENCODING  ` . This is the default.
  - `  DUMMY_ENCODING  `

### `     AUTO_CLASS_WEIGHTS    `

**Syntax**

``` text
AUTO_CLASS_WEIGHTS = { TRUE | FALSE }
```

**Description**

Determines whether to balance class labels by using weights for each class in inverse proportion to the frequency of that class.

Only use this option with logistic regression models.

By default, the training data used to create the model is unweighted. If the labels in the training data are imbalanced, the model might learn to predict the most popular class of labels more heavily, which you might not want.

To balance every class, set this option to `  TRUE  ` . Balance is accomplished using the following formula:

``` text
total_input_rows / (input_rows_for_class_n * number_of_unique_classes)
```

**Arguments**

A `  BOOL  ` value. The default value is `  FALSE  ` .

### `     CLASS_WEIGHTS    `

**Syntax**

`  CLASS_WEIGHTS = struct_array  `

**Description**

The weights to use for each class label. You can't specify this option if [`  AUTO_CLASS_WEIGHTS  `](#auto_class_weights) is `  TRUE  ` .

**Arguments**

An `  ARRAY  ` of `  STRUCT  ` values. Each `  STRUCT  ` contains a `  STRING  ` value that specifies the class label and a `  FLOAT64  ` value that specifies the weight for that class label. A weight must be present for every class label. The weights are not required to add up to 1.

A `  CLASS_WEIGHTS  ` value might look like the following example:

``` text
CLASS_WEIGHTS = [STRUCT('example_label', .2)]
```

### `     ENABLE_GLOBAL_EXPLAIN    `

**Syntax**

``` text
ENABLE_GLOBAL_EXPLAIN = { TRUE | FALSE }
```

**Description**

Determines whether to compute global explanations by using [explainable AI](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-xai-overview) to evaluate the importance of global features to the model.

Global explanations are computed when you create the model. This option must be `  TRUE  ` if you want to use the [`  ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-global-explain) to retrieve the global explanations after the model is created.

**Arguments**

A `  BOOL  ` value. The default value is `  FALSE  ` .

### `     INPUT_LABEL_COLS    `

**Syntax**

`  INPUT_LABEL_COLS = string_array  `

**Description**

The name of the label column in the training data. The label column contains the expected machine learning result for the given record. For example, in a spam detection dataset, the label column value would probably be either `  spam  ` or `  not spam  ` . In a rainfall dataset, the label column value might be the amount of rain that fell during a certain period.

**Arguments**

A one-element `  ARRAY  ` of string values. Defaults to `  label  ` .

### `     L1_REG    `

**Syntax**

`  L1_REG = { float64_value | HPARAM_RANGE( range ) | HPARAM_CANDIDATES( [candidates] ) }  `

**Description**

The amount of [L1 regularization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#L1_regularization) applied.

**Arguments**

If you aren't running hyperparameter tuning, then you can specify a `  FLOAT64  ` value. The default value is `  0  ` .

If you are running hyperparameter tuning, then you can use one of the following options:

  - The `  HPARAM_RANGE  ` keyword and two `  FLOAT64  ` values that define the range to use for the hyperparameter. For example, `  L1_REG = HPARAM_RANGE(0, 5.0)  ` .
  - The `  HPARAM_CANDIDATES  ` keyword and an array of `  FLOAT64  ` values that provide discrete values to use for the hyperparameter. For example, `  L1_REG = HPARAM_CANDIDATES([0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0])  ` .

When running hyperparameter tuning, the valid range is `  (0, ∞)  ` , the default range is `  (0, 10.0]  ` , and the scale type is `  LOG  ` .

### `     L2_REG    `

**Syntax**

`  L2_REG = { float64_value | HPARAM_RANGE( range ) | HPARAM_CANDIDATES( [candidates] ) }  `

The amount of [L2 regularization](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#L2_regularization) applied.

**Arguments**

If you aren't running hyperparameter tuning, then you can specify a `  FLOAT64  ` value. The default value is `  0  ` .

If you are running hyperparameter tuning, then you can use one of the following options:

  - The `  HPARAM_RANGE  ` keyword and two `  FLOAT64  ` values that define the range to use for the hyperparameter. For example, `  L2_REG = HPARAM_RANGE(1.5, 5.0)  ` .
  - The `  HPARAM_CANDIDATES  ` keyword and an array of `  FLOAT64  ` values that provide discrete values to use for the hyperparameter. For example, `  L2_REG = HPARAM_CANDIDATES([0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0])  ` .

When running hyperparameter tuning, the valid range is `  (0, ∞)  ` , the default range is `  (0, 10.0]  ` , and the scale type is `  LOG  ` .

### `     MAX_ITERATIONS    `

**Syntax**

`  MAX_ITERATIONS = int64_value  `

**Description**

The maximum number of training iterations, where one iteration represents a single pass of the entire training data.

**Arguments**

An `  INT64  ` value. The default value is `  20  ` .

### `     WARM_START    `

**Syntax**

``` text
WARM_START = { TRUE | FALSE }
```

**Description**

Determines whether to train a model with new training data, new model options, or both. Unless you explicitly override them, the initial options used to train the model are used for the warm start run.

In a warm start run, the iteration numbers are reset to start from zero. Use the training run or iteration information returned by the [`  ML.TRAINING_INFO  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-train) to distinguish the warm start run from the original run.

The values of the `  MODEL_TYPE  ` and `  LABELS  ` options and the training data schema must remain constant in a warm start.

**Arguments**

A `  BOOL  ` value. The default value is `  FALSE  ` .

### `     EARLY_STOP    `

**Syntax**

``` text
EARLY_STOP = { TRUE | FALSE }
```

**Description**

Determines whether training should stop after the first iteration in which the relative loss improvement is less than the value specified for [`  MIN_REL_PROGRESS  `](#min_rel_progress) .

**Arguments**

A `  BOOL  ` value. The default value is `  TRUE  ` .

### `     MIN_REL_PROGRESS    `

**Syntax**

`  MIN_REL_PROGRESS = float64_value  `

**Description**

The minimum relative loss improvement that is necessary to continue training when [`  EARLY_STOP  `](#early_stop) is set to `  TRUE  ` . For example, a value of `  0.01  ` specifies that each iteration must reduce the loss by 1% for training to continue.

**Arguments**

A `  FLOAT64  ` value. The default value is `  0.01  ` .

### `     DATA_SPLIT_METHOD    `

**Syntax**

``` text
DATA_SPLIT_METHOD = { 'AUTO_SPLIT' | 'RANDOM' | 'CUSTOM' | 'SEQ' | 'NO_SPLIT' }
```

**Description**

The method used to split input data into training, evaluation, and, if you are running hyperparameter tuning, test data sets. Training data is used to train the model. Evaluation data is used to avoid [overfitting](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#overfitting) by using early stopping. Test data is used to test the hyperparameter tuning trial and record its metrics in the model.

The percentage sizes of the data sets produced by the various arguments for this option are approximate. Larger input data sets come closer to the percentages described than smaller input data sets do.

You can see the model's data split information in the following ways:

  - The data split method and percentage are shown in the **Training Options** section of the model's **Details** page on the BigQuery page of the Google Cloud console.
  - Links to temporary tables that contain the split data are available in the **Model Details** section of the model's **Details** page on the BigQuery of the Google Cloud console. You can also return this information from the [`  DataSplitResult  ` field](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/models#datasplitresult) in the BigQuery API. These tables are saved for 48 hours. If you need this information for more than 48 hours, then you should export this data or copy it to permanent tables.

**Arguments**

This option accepts the following values:

\* `  AUTO_SPLIT  ` : This is the default value. This option splits the data as follows:

  - If there are fewer than 500 rows in the input data, then all rows are used as training data.

  - If you aren't running hyperparameter tuning, then data is randomized and split as follows:
    
      - If there are between 500 and 50,000 rows in the input data, then 20% of the data is used as evaluation data and 80% is used as training data.
      - If there are more than 50,000 rows, then 10,000 rows are used as evaluation data and the remaining rows are used as training data.

  - If you are running hyperparameter tuning and there are more than 500 rows in the input data, then the data is randomized and split as follows:
    
      - 10% of the data is used as evaluation data
    
      - 10% is used as test data
    
      - 80% is used as training data
        
        For more information, see [Data split](/bigquery/docs/hp-tuning-overview#data_split) .

  - `  RANDOM  ` : Data is randomized before being split into sets. You can use this option with the [`  DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION  `](#data_split_eval_fraction) and [`  DATA_SPLIT_TEST_FRACTION  `](#data_split_test_fraction) options to customize the data split. If you don't specify either of those options, data is split in the same way as for the `  AUTO_SPLIT  ` option.
    
    A random split is deterministic: different training runs produce the same split results if the same underlying training data is used.
    
    **Note:** A random split is based on the [FARM\_FINGERPRINT](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/hash_functions#farm_fingerprint) of the data (including the column name and schema), so tables with the same content but different column names and schemas may get different splitting and different evaluation metrics.

  - `  CUSTOM  ` : Split data using the value in a specified column:
    
      - If you aren't running hyperparameter tuning, then you must provide the name of a column of type `  BOOL  ` . Rows with a value of `  TRUE  ` or `  NULL  ` are used as evaluation data, rows with a value of `  FALSE  ` are used as training data.
      - If you are running hyperparameter tuning, then you must provide the name of a column of type `  STRING  ` . Rows with a value of `  TRAIN  ` are used as training data, rows with a value of `  EVAL  ` are used as evaluation data, and rows with a value of `  TEST  ` are used as test data.
    
    Use the [`  DATA_SPLIT_COL  ` option](#data_split_col) to identify the column that contains the data split information.

  - `  SEQ  ` : Split data sequentially by using the value in a specified column of one of the following types:
    
      - `  NUMERIC  `
      - `  BIGNUMERIC  `
      - `  STRING  `
      - `  TIMESTAMP  `
    
    The data is sorted smallest to largest based on the specified column.
    
    When you aren't running hyperparameter tuning, the first n rows are used as evaluation data, where n is the value specified for `  DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION  ` . The remaining rows are used as training data.
    
    When you are running hyperparameter tuning, the first n rows are used as evaluation data, where n is the value specified for `  DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION  ` . The next m rows are used as test data, where m is the value specified for `  DATA_SPLIT_TEST_FRACTION  ` . The remaining rows are used as training data.
    
    All rows with split values smaller than the threshold are used as training data. The remaining rows, including `  NULLs  ` , are used as evaluation data.
    
    Use the `  DATA_SPLIT_COL  ` option to identify the column that contains the data split information.

  - `  NO_SPLIT  ` : No data split; all input data is used as training data.

### `     DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION    `

**Syntax**

`  DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION = float64_value  `

**Description**

The fraction of the data to use as evaluation data. Use when you are specifying `  RANDOM  ` or `  SEQ  ` as the value for the [`  DATA_SPLIT_METHOD  ` option](#data_split_method) .

If you are running hyperparameter tuning and you specify a value for this option, you must also specify a value for [`  DATA_SPLIT_TEST_FRACTION  `](#data_split_test_fraction) . In this case, the training dataset is `  1 - eval_fraction - test_fraction  ` . For example, if you specify `  20.00  ` for `  DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION  ` and `  8.0  ` for `  DATA_SPLIT_TEST_FRACTION  ` , your training dataset is 72% of the input data.

**Arguments**

A `  FLOAT64  ` value. The default is `  0.2  ` . The service maintains the accuracy of the input value to two decimal places.

### `     DATA_SPLIT_TEST_FRACTION    `

**Syntax**

`  DATA_SPLIT_TEST_FRACTION = float64_value  `

**Description**

The fraction of the data to use as test data. Use this option when you are running hyperparameter tuning and specifying either `  RANDOM  ` or `  SEQ  ` as value for the [`  DATA_SPLIT_METHOD  ` option](#data_split_method) .

If you specify a value for this option, you must also specify a value for [`  DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION  `](#data_split_eval_fraction) . In this case, the training dataset is `  1 - eval_fraction - test_fraction  ` . For example, if you specify `  20.00  ` for `  DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION  ` and `  8.0  ` for `  DATA_SPLIT_TEST_FRACTION  ` , your training dataset is 72% of the input data.

**Arguments**

A `  FLOAT64  ` value. The default is `  0  ` . The service maintains the accuracy of the input value to two decimal places.

### `     DATA_SPLIT_COL    `

**Syntax**

`  DATA_SPLIT_COL = string_value  `

**Description**

The name of the column to use to sort input data into the training, evaluation, or test set. Use when you are specifying `  CUSTOM  ` or `  SEQ  ` as the value for the [`  DATA_SPLIT_METHOD  ` option](#data_split_method) :

  - If you aren't running hyperparameter tuning and you are specifying `  SEQ  ` as the value for `  DATA_SPLIT_METHOD  ` , then the data is first sorted smallest to largest based on the specified column. The last n rows are used as evaluation data, where n is the value specified for [`  DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION  `](#data_split_eval_fraction) . The remaining rows are used as training data.
  - If you aren't running hyperparameter tuning and you are specifying `  CUSTOM  ` as the value for `  DATA_SPLIT_METHOD  ` , then you must provide the name of a column of type `  BOOL  ` . Rows with a value of `  TRUE  ` or `  NULL  ` are used as evaluation data, rows with a value of `  FALSE  ` are used as training data.
  - If you are running hyperparameter tuning and you are specifying `  SEQ  ` as the value for `  DATA_SPLIT_METHOD  ` , then the data is first sorted smallest to largest based on the specified column. The last n rows are used as evaluation data, where n is the value specified for [`  DATA_SPLIT_EVAL_FRACTION  `](#data_split_eval_fraction) . The next m rows are used as test data, where m is the value specified for [`  DATA_SPLIT_TEST_FRACTION  `](#data_split_test_fraction) . The remaining rows are used as training data.
  - If you are running hyperparameter tuning and you are specifying `  CUSTOM  ` as the value for `  DATA_SPLIT_METHOD  ` , then you must provide the name of a column of type `  STRING  ` . Rows with a value of `  TRAIN  ` are used as training data, rows with a value of `  EVAL  ` are used as evaluation data, and rows with a value of `  TEST  ` are used as test data.

The column you specify for `  DATA_SPLIT_COL  ` can't be used as a feature or label, and is excluded from features automatically.

**Arguments**

A `  STRING  ` value.

### `     NUM_TRIALS    `

**Syntax**

`  NUM_TRIALS = int64_value  `

**Description**

The maximum number of submodels to train. The tuning stops when `  NUM_TRIALS  ` submodels are trained, or when the hyperparameter search space is exhausted. You must specify this option in order to use hyperparameter tuning.

**Arguments**

An `  INT64  ` value between `  1  ` and `  100  ` , inclusive.

**Note:** We recommend using at least `  ( number_of_hyperparameters * 10)  ` trials to tune a model.

### `     MAX_PARALLEL_TRIALS    `

**Syntax**

`  MAX_PARALLEL_TRIALS = int64_value  `

**Description**

The maximum number of trials to run at the same time. If you specify a value for this option, you must also specify a value for [`  NUM_TRIALS  `](#num_trials) .

**Arguments**

An `  INT64  ` value between `  1  ` and `  5  ` , inclusive. The default value is `  1  ` .

**Note:** Although specifying larger `  MAX_PARALLEL_TRIALS  ` values can accelerate the hyperparameter tuning process, acceleration can undermine the final model quality when you specify `  VIZIER_DEFAULT  ` as the [`  HPARAM_TUNING_ALGORITHM  `](#hparam_tuning_algorithm) value. This is because the parallel trials can't benefit from concurrent training results.

### `     HPARAM_TUNING_ALGORITHM    `

**Syntax**

``` text
HPARAM_TUNING_ALGORITHM = { 'VIZIER_DEFAULT' | 'RANDOM_SEARCH' | 'GRID_SEARCH' }
```

**Description**

The algorithm used to tune the hyperparameters. If you specify a value for this option, you must also specify a value for [`  NUM_TRIALS  `](#num_trials) .

**Arguments**

Specify one of the following values:

  - `  VIZIER_DEFAULT  ` : Use the default algorithm in Vertex AI Vizier to tune hyperparameters. This algorithm is the most powerful algorithm of those offered. It performs a mixture of advanced search algorithms, including [Bayesian optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization) with [Gaussian processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) . It also uses [transfer learning](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-hyperparameter-tuning#transfer_learning) to take advantage of previously tuned models. This is the default, and also the recommended approach.

  - `  RANDOM_SEARCH  ` : Use [random search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization#Random_search) to explore the search space.

  - `  GRID_SEARCH  ` : Use [grid search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization#Grid_search) to explore the search space. You can only use this algorithm when every hyperparameter's search space is discrete.

### `     HPARAM_TUNING_OBJECTIVES    `

**Syntax**

For `  LINEAR_REG  ` models:

``` text
HPARAM_TUNING_OBJECTIVES = { 'R2_SCORE' | 'EXPLAINED_VARIANCE' | 'MEDIAN_ABSOLUTE_ERROR' | 'MEAN_ABSOLUTE_ERROR' | 'MEAN_SQUARED_ERROR' | 'MEAN_SQUARED_LOG_ERROR' }
```

For `  LOGISTIC_REG  ` models:

``` text
HPARAM_TUNING_OBJECTIVES = { 'ROC_AUC' | 'PRECISION' | 'RECALL' | 'ACCURACY' | 'F1_SCORE' | 'LOG_LOSS' }
```

**Description**

The hyperparameter tuning objective for the model; only one objective is supported. If you specify a value for this option, you must also specify a value for [`  NUM_TRIALS  `](#num_trials) .

**Arguments**

The possible objectives are a subset of the [model evaluation metrics](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-evaluate#output) for the model type. If you aren't running hyperparameter tuning, or if you are and you don't specify an objective, then the default objective is used. For `  LINEAR_REG  ` models, the default is `  R2_SCORE  ` . For `  LOGISTIC_REG  ` models, the default is `  ROC_AUC  ` .

### `     MODEL_REGISTRY    `

The `  MODEL_REGISTRY  ` option specifies the model registry destination. `  VERTEX_AI  ` is the only supported model registry destination. To learn more, see [Register a BigQuery ML model](/bigquery/docs/create_vertex#register-model) .

### `     VERTEX_AI_MODEL_ID    `

The `  VERTEX_AI_MODEL_ID  ` option specifies a Vertex AI model ID to register the model with. The model ID is associated with your BigQuery ML model, and is visible from the Model Registry. If you don't specify a Vertex AI model ID, the BigQuery ML model name is used.

The `  VERTEX_AI_MODEL_ID  ` value can have up to 63 characters, and valid characters are `  [a-z0-9_-]  ` . The first character cannot be a number or hyphen. If you don't specify a Vertex AI model ID, the BigQuery ML model name must meet these requirements.

You can only set the `  VERTEX_AI_MODEL_ID  ` option when the `  MODEL_REGISTRY  ` option is set to `  VERTEX_AI  ` .

### `     VERTEX_AI_MODEL_VERSION_ALIASES    `

The `  VERTEX_AI_MODEL_VERSION_ALIASES  ` option specifies a Vertex AI model alias to use when registering a model. Model aliases are helpful for fetching or deploying a particular model version by reference without needing to know the specific version ID. To learn more about how Model Registry aliases work, see [How to use model version aliases](/vertex-ai/docs/model-registry/model-alias) .

You can only set the `  VERTEX_AI_MODEL_VERSION_ALIASES  ` option when the `  MODEL_REGISTRY  ` option is set to `  VERTEX_AI  ` .

### `     KMS_KEY_NAME    `

**Syntax**

`  KMS_KEY_NAME = string_value  `

**Description**

The Cloud Key Management Service [customer-managed encryption key (CMEK)](/kms/docs/cmek) to use to encrypt the model.

**Arguments**

A `  STRING  ` value containing the fully-qualified name of the CMEK. For example,

``` text
'projects/my_project/locations/my_location/keyRings/my_ring/cryptoKeys/my_key'
```

### `     query_statement    `

The `  AS query_statement  ` clause specifies the GoogleSQL query used to generate the training data. See the [GoogleSQL query syntax](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#sql_syntax) page for the supported SQL syntax of the `  query_statement  ` clause.

All columns referenced by the `  query_statement  ` are used as input [features](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#feature) to the model except for the columns included in [`  INPUT_LABEL_COLS  `](#input_label_cols) and [`  DATA_SPLIT_COL  `](#data_split_col) .

## Hyperparameter tuning

Linear and logistic regression models support [hyperparameter tuning](/bigquery/docs/hp-tuning-overview) , which you can use to improve model performance for your data. To use hyperparameter tuning, set the [`  NUM_TRIALs  ` option](#num_trials) to the number of trials that you want to run. BigQuery ML then trains the model the number of times that you specify, using different hyperparameter values, and returns the model that performs the best.

Hyperparameter tuning defaults to improving the key performance metric for the given model type. You can use the [`  HPARAM_TUNING_OBJECTIVES  ` option](#hparam_tuning_objectives) to tune for a different metric if you need to.

For more information about the training objectives and hyperparameters supported for linear regression models, see [`  LINEAR_REG  `](/bigquery/docs/hp-tuning-overview#linear_reg) . For more information about the training objectives and hyperparameters supported for logistic regression models, see [`  LOGISTIC_REG  `](/bigquery/docs/hp-tuning-overview#logistic_reg) . To try a tutorial that walks you through hyperparameter tuning, see [Improve model performance with hyperparameter tuning](/bigquery/docs/hyperparameter-tuning-tutorial) .

## Locations

For information about supported locations, see [Locations for non-remote models](/bigquery/docs/locations#locations-for-non-remote-models) .

## Limitations

`  CREATE MODEL  ` statements must comply with the following rules:

  - For linear regression models, the `  label  ` column must be real-valued (the column values cannot be +/- infinity or `  NaN  ` ).
  - For logistic regression models, the `  label  ` column can contain up to 50 unique values; that is, the number of classes is less than or equal to 50. If you need to classify into more than 50 labels, contact <bqml-feedback@google.com> .

## Examples

The following examples create models named `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` in your default project.

  column4 < 10
```

### Train a linear regression model with a sequential data split

The following example creates a linear regression model with a sequential data split. The split fraction is `  0.3  ` and the split uses the `  timestamp  ` column as the basis for the split.

``` text
CREATE MODEL
  `mydataset.mymodel`
OPTIONS
  ( MODEL_TYPE='LINEAR_REG',

```

### Train a linear regression model with a custom data split

The following example creates a linear regression model using a custom data split method and trains the model by joining the data from the evaluation and training tables. All the columns in the training table and in the evaluation table are either features or the label. The query uses `  SELECT *  ` and `  UNION ALL  ` to append all of the data in the `  split_col  ` column to the existing data.

``` text
CREATE MODEL
  `mydataset.mymodel`
OPTIONS
  ( MODEL_TYPE='LINEAR_REG',
    DATA_SPLIT_METHOD='CUSTOM',
    DATA_SPLIT_COL='SPLIT_COL' ) AS
SELECT
  *,
  false AS split_col
FROM
  `mydataset.training_table`
UNION ALL
SELECT
  *,
  true AS split_col
FROM
  `mydataset.evaluation_table`
```

### Train a linear regression model with hyperparameter tuning

  column2,
  column3,
  label
FROM
  `mydataset.mytable`
```

### Train a multiclass logistic regression model with automatically calculated weights

  ( MODEL_TYPE='LOGISTIC_REG',
    AUTO_CLASS_WEIGHTS=TRUE ) AS
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `mydataset.mytable`
```

### Train a multiclass logistic regression model with specified weights

The following example creates a multiclass logistic regression model using the `  class_weights  ` option. The label columns are `  label1  ` , `  label2  ` , and `  label3  ` .

``` text
CREATE MODEL
  `mydataset.mymodel`
OPTIONS
  ( MODEL_TYPE='LOGISTIC_REG',
    CLASS_WEIGHTS=[('label1', 0.5), ('label2', 0.3), ('label3', 0.2)]) AS
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `mydataset.mytable`
```

The following example creates a logistic regression model using the `  class_weights  ` option.

``` text
CREATE MODEL
  `mydataset.mymodel`
OPTIONS
  ( MODEL_TYPE='LOGISTIC_REG',
    CLASS_WEIGHTS=[('0', 0.9), ('1', 0.1)]) AS
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `mydataset.mytable`
```

### Train a logistic regression model with hyperparameter tuning

  `mydataset.mymodel`
OPTIONS
  ( MODEL_TYPE='LOGISTIC_REG',
    num_trials=10,
    max_parallel_trials=2,
    HPARAM_TUNING_OBJECTIVES=['ROC_AUC'] ) AS
SELECT
  column1,
  column2,
  column3,
  label
FROM
  `mydataset.mytable`
```

### Model creation with `     TRANSFORM    ` , while excluding original columns

The following example trains a model after adding the columns `  f1  ` and `  f2  ` from the `  SELECT  ` statement to form a new column `  c  ` ; the columns `  f1  ` and `  f2  ` are omitted from the training data. Model training uses columns `  f3  ` and `  label_col  ` as they appear in the data source `  t  ` .

``` text
CREATE MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`
  TRANSFORM(f1 + f2 as c, * EXCEPT(f1, f2))
  OPTIONS(model_type='linear_reg', input_label_cols=['label_col'])
AS SELECT f1, f2, f3, label_col FROM t;
```
