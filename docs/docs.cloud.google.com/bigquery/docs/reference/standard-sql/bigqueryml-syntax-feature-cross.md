# The ML.FEATURE\_CROSS function

This document describes the `  ML.FEATURE_CROSS  ` function, which lets you create [feature crosses](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/feature-crosses/video-lecture) .

You can use this function with models that support [manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) . For more information, see the following documents:

  - [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey)
  - [Contribution analysis user journey](/bigquery/docs/contribution-analysis#contribution_analysis_user_journey)

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.FEATURE_CROSS(struct_categorical_features [, degree])
```

### Arguments

`  ML.FEATURE_CROSS  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  struct_categorical_features  ` : a `  STRUCT<STRING>  ` value that specifies the categorical features to cross. The maximum number of input features is 10. Don't specify unnamed features or duplicate features in `  struct_numerical_features  ` .
  - `  degree  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies the highest degree of all combinations of features in the range of `  [2, 4]  ` . The default value is `  2  ` .

## Output

`  ML.FEATURE_CROSS  ` returns a `  STRUCT<STRING>  ` value that identifies all combinations of the crossed categorical features with a degree no larger than the `  degree  ` value, except for 1-degree items (the original features) and self-crossing items. The field names in the output struct are concatenations of the original feature names.

## Example

The following example crosses three features:

``` text
SELECT
  ML.FEATURE_CROSS(STRUCT('a' AS f1, 'b' AS f2, 'c' AS f3)) AS output;
```

The output looks similar to the following:

``` console
+---------------------------------------------+
|                   output                    |
+---------------------------------------------+
| {"f1_f2":"a_b","f1_f3":"a_c","f2_f3":"b_c"} |
+---------------------------------------------+
```
