# The ML.FEATURE\_IMPORTANCE function

This document describes the `  ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE  ` function, which lets you see the feature importance score. This score indicates how useful or valuable each feature was in the construction of a boosted tree or a random forest model during training. For more information, see the [`  feature_importances  ` property](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html?#xgboost.XGBRegressor.feature_importances_) in the XGBoost library.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL`
)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the model.
  - `  MODEL  ` : the name of the model.

## Output

`  ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  feature  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the name of the feature column in the input training data.
  - `  importance_weight  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the number of times a feature is used to split the data across all trees.
  - `  importance_gain  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the average gain across all splits the feature is used in.
  - `  importance_cover  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the average coverage across all splits the feature is used in.

If the [`  TRANSFORM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform) was used in the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement that created the model, `  ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE  ` returns the information of the pre-transform columns from the `  query_statement  ` clause of the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement.

## Permissions

You must have the `  bigquery.models.create  ` and `  bigquery.models.getData  ` [Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bq-permissions) in order to run `  ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE  ` .

## Limitations

`  ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE  ` is only supported with [boosted tree models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-boosted-tree) and [random forest models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-random-forest) .

## Example

This example retrieves feature importance from `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` . The dataset is in your default project.

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.FEATURE_IMPORTANCE(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`)
```
