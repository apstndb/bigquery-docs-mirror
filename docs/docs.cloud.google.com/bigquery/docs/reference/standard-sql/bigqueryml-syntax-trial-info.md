# The ML.TRIAL\_INFO function

This document describes the `  ML.TRIAL_INFO  ` function, which lets you display information about trials from a model that uses [hyperparameter tuning](/bigquery/docs/hp-tuning-overview) .

You can use this function with models that support [hyperparameter tuning](/bigquery/docs/hp-tuning-overview) . For more information, see [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey) .

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.TRIAL_INFO(MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL_NAME`)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.TRIAL_INFO  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the model.
  - `  MODEL_NAME  ` : The name of the model.

## Output

`  ML.TRIAL_INFO  ` returns one row per trial with the following columns:

  - `  trial_id  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that contains the ID assigned to each trial in the approximate order of trial execution. `  trial_id  ` values start from `  1  ` .

  - `  hyperparameters  ` : a `  STRUCT  ` value that contains the hyperparameters used in the trial.

  - `  hparam_tuning_evaluation_metrics  ` : a `  STRUCT  ` value that contains the evaluation metrics appropriate to the hyperparameter tuning objective specified by the [`  hparam_tuning_objectives  ` argument](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#hparam_tuning_objectives) in the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement. Metrics are calculated from the evaluation data. For more information about the datasets used in hyperparameter tuning, see [Data split](/bigquery/docs/hp-tuning-overview#data_split) .

  - `  training_loss  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the loss of the trial during the last iteration, calculated using the training data.

  - `  eval_loss  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the loss of the trial during the last iteration, calculated using the evaluation data.

  - `  status  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the final status of the trial. Possible values include the following:
    
      - `  SUCCEEDED  ` : the trial succeeded.
      - `  FAILED  ` : the trial failed.
      - `  INFEASIBLE  ` : the trial was not run due to an invalid combination of hyperparameters.

  - `  error_message  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the error message that is returned if the trial didn't succeed. For more information, see [Error handling](/bigquery/docs/hp-tuning-overview#error_handling) .

  - `  is_optimal  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that indicates whether the trial had the best objective value. If multiple trials are marked as optimal, then the trial with the smallest `  trial_id  ` value is used as the default trial during model serving.

## Example

The following query retrieves information of all trials for the model `  mydataset.mymodel  ` in your default project:

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.TRIAL_INFO(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`)
```
