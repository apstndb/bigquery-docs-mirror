# The ML.FEATURES\_AT\_TIME function

This document describes the `  ML.FEATURES_AT_TIME  ` function, which lets you use a point-in-time cutoff for all entities when retrieving features, because features can have time dependencies if they include time-sensitive data. To avoid [data leakage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leakage_\(machine_learning\)) , use point-in-time features when training models and running inference.

Use this function to use the same point-in-time cutoff for all entities when retrieving features. Use the [`  ML.ENTITY_FEATURES_AT_TIME  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-entity-feature-time) to retrieve features from multiple points in time for multiple entities.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.FEATURES_AT_TIME(
   { TABLE `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.TABLE_NAME` | (QUERY_STATEMENT) }
   [, TIME => TIMESTAMP][, NUM_ROWS => INT64][, IGNORE_FEATURE_NULLS => BOOL])
```

### Arguments

`  ML.FEATURES_AT_TIME  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the project that contains the table.

  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the table.

  - `  TABLE_NAME  ` : is the name of the BigQuery table that contains the feature data. The feature table must contain the following columns:
    
      - `  entity_id  ` : a `  STRING  ` column that contains the ID of the entity related to the features.
      - One or more feature columns.
      - `  feature_timestamp  ` : a `  TIMESTAMP  ` column that identifies when the feature data was last updated.
    
    The column names are case-insensitive. For example, you can use a column named `  Entity_ID  ` instead of `  entity_id  ` .
    
    The feature table must be in [wide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_and_narrow_data#Wide) format, with one column for each feature.

  - `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that specifies a GoogleSQL query that returns the feature data. This query must return the same columns as the `  TABLE_NAME  ` argument. See [GoogleSQL query syntax](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#sql_syntax) for the supported SQL syntax of the `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` clause.

  - `  TIME  ` : a `  TIMESTAMP  ` value that specifies the point in time to use as a cutoff for feature data. Only rows where the value in the `  feature_timestamp  ` column is equal to or earlier than the `  TIME  ` value are returned. Defaults to the value of the [`  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#current_timestamp) .

  - `  NUM_ROWS  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies the number of rows to return for each entity ID. Defaults to `  1  ` .

  - `  IGNORE_FEATURE_NULLS  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that indicates whether to replace a `  NULL  ` value in a feature column with the feature column value from the row for the same entity that immediately precedes it in time. For example, for the following feature table:
    
    ``` console
    +-----------+------+------+--------------------------+
    | entity_id | f1   | f2   | feature_timestamp        |
    +-----------+------+------+--------------------------+
    | '2'       | 5.0  | 8.0  | '2022-06-10 09:00:00+00' |
    +-----------+------+------+--------------------------+
    | '2'       | 2.0  | 4.0  | '2022-06-10 12:00:00+00' |
    +-----------+------+------+--------------------------+
    | '2'       | 7.0  | NULL | '2022-06-11 10:00:00+00' |
    +-----------+------+------+--------------------------+
    ```
    
    Running this query:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT *
    FROM
      ML.FEATURES_AT_TIME(
        TABLE mydataset.feature_table,
        time => '2022-06-11 10:00:00+00',
        num_rows => 1,
        ignore_feature_nulls => TRUE);
    ```
    
    Results in the following output, where the `  f2  ` value from the row for entity ID 2 that is timestamped `  '2022-06-10 12:00:00+00'  ` is substituted for the `  NULL  ` value in the row timestamped `  '2022-06-11 10:00:00+00'  ` :
    
    ``` console
    +-----------+------+------+--------------------------+
    | entity_id | f1   | f2   | feature_timestamp        |
    +-----------+------+------+--------------------------+
    | '2'       | 7.0  | 4.0  | '2022-06-11 10:00:00+00' |
    +-----------+------+------+--------------------------+
    ```
    
    If there is no available replacement value, for example, where there is no earlier row for that entity ID, a `  NULL  ` value is returned.
    
    Defaults to `  FALSE  ` .

## Output

The `  ML.FEATURES_AT_TIME  ` function returns the input table rows that meet the point-in-time cutoff criteria, with the `  feature_timestamp  ` column showing the timestamp that was input in the `  time  ` argument.

## Examples

**Example 1**

This example shows a how to retrain a model using only features that were created or updated before `  2023-01-01 12:00:00+00  ` :

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE
  `mydataset.mymodel` OPTIONS (WARM_START = TRUE)
AS
SELECT * EXCEPT (feature_timestamp, entity_id)
FROM
  ML.FEATURES_AT_TIME(
    TABLE `mydataset.feature_table`,
    time => '2023-01-01 12:00:00+00',
    num_rows => 1,
    ignore_feature_nulls => TRUE);
```

**Example 2**

This example shows how to get predictions from a model based on features that were created or updated before `  2023-01-01 12:00:00+00  ` :

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(
    MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`,
    (
      SELECT * EXCEPT (feature_timestamp, entity_id)
      FROM
        ML.FEATURES_AT_TIME(
          TABLE `mydataset.feature_table`,
          time => '2023-01-01 12:00:00+00',
          num_rows => 1,
          ignore_feature_nulls => TRUE)
    )
  );
```

**Example 3**

This is a contrived example that you can use to see the output of the function:

``` text
WITH
  feature_table AS (
    SELECT * FROM UNNEST(
      ARRAY<STRUCT<entity_id STRING, f_1 FLOAT64, f_2 FLOAT64, feature_timestamp TIMESTAMP>>[
        ('id1', 1.0, 1.0, TIMESTAMP '2022-06-10 12:00:00+00'),
        ('id2', 12.0, 24.0, TIMESTAMP '2022-06-11 12:00:00+00'),
        ('id1', 11.0, NULL, TIMESTAMP '2022-06-11 12:00:00+00'),
        ('id1', 6.0, 12.0, TIMESTAMP '2022-06-11 10:00:00+00'),
        ('id2', 2.0, 4.0, TIMESTAMP '2022-06-10 12:00:00+00'),
        ('id2', 7.0, NULL, TIMESTAMP '2022-06-11 10:00:00+00')])
  )
SELECT *
FROM
  ML.FEATURES_AT_TIME(
    TABLE feature_table,
    time => '2022-06-12 10:00:00+00',
    num_rows => 1,
    ignore_feature_nulls => TRUE);
```
