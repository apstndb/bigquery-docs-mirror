# The ML.MULTI\_HOT\_ENCODER function

This document describes the `  ML.MULTI_HOT_ENCODER  ` function, which lets you encode a string array expression by using a [multi-hot](/bigquery/docs/auto-preprocessing#feature-transform) encoding scheme.

The encoding vocabulary is sorted alphabetically. `  NULL  ` values and categories that aren't in the vocabulary are encoded with an `  index  ` value of `  0  ` .

When used in the [`  TRANSFORM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform) , the vocabulary calculated during training, along with the top *k* and frequency threshold values that you specified, are automatically used in prediction.

You can use this function with models that support [manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) . For more information, see the following documents:

  - [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey)
  - [Contribution analysis user journey](/bigquery/docs/contribution-analysis#contribution_analysis_user_journey)

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.MULTI_HOT_ENCODER(array_expression [, top_k] [, frequency_threshold]) OVER()
```

### Arguments

`  ML.MULTI_HOT_ENCODER  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  array_expression  ` : the `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` expression to encode.
  - `  top_k  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies the number of categories included in the encoding vocabulary. The function selects the `  top_k  ` most frequent categories in the data and uses those; categories below this threshold are encoded to `  0  ` . This value must be less than `  1,000,000  ` to avoid problems due to high dimensionality. The default value is `  32,000  ` .
  - `  frequency_threshold  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that limits the categories included in the encoding vocabulary based on category frequency. The function uses categories whose frequency is greater than or equal to `  frequency_threshold  ` ; categories below this threshold are encoded to `  0  ` . The default value is `  5  ` .

## Output

`  ML.MULTI_HOT_ENCODER  ` returns an array of struct values in the form `  ARRAY<STRUCT<INT64, FLOAT64>>  ` . The first element in the struct provides the index of the encoded string expression, and the second element provides the value of the encoded string expression.

## Example

The following example performs multi-hot encoding on a set of string array expressions. It limits the encoding vocabulary to the three categories that occur the most frequently in the data and that also occur one or more times.

``` text
SELECT f[OFFSET(0)] AS f0, ML.MULTI_HOT_ENCODER(f, 3, 1) OVER () AS output
FROM
  (
    SELECT ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', NULL] AS f
    UNION ALL
    SELECT ['c', 'c', 'd', 'd', NULL] AS f
  )
ORDER BY f[OFFSET(0)];
```

The output looks similar to the following:

``` console
+------+-----------------------------+
|  f0  | output.index | output.value |
+------+--------------+--------------+
|  a   |  1           |  1.0         |
|      |  2           |  1.0         |
|      |  3           |  1.0         |
|      |  0           |  1.0         |
|  c   |  3           |  1.0         |
|      |  0           |  1.0         |
+------+-----------------------------+
```
