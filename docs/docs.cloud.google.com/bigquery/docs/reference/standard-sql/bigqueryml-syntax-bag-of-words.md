# The ML.BAG\_OF\_WORDS function

Use the `  ML.BAG_OF_WORDS  ` function to compute a representation of tokenized documents as the bag (multiset) of its words, disregarding word ordering and grammar.

You can use this function with models that support [manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) . For more information, see the following documents:

  - [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey)
  - [Contribution analysis user journey](/bigquery/docs/contribution-analysis#contribution_analysis_user_journey)

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.BAG_OF_WORDS(
  tokenized_document
  [, top_k]
  [, frequency_threshold]
)
OVER()
```

### Arguments

`  ML.BAG_OF_WORDS  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  tokenized_document  ` : `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` value that represents a document that has been tokenized. A tokenized document is a collection of terms (tokens), which are used for text analysis. For more information about tokenization in BigQuery, see [`  TEXT_ANALYZE  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/text-analysis-functions#text_analyze) .
  - `  top_k  ` : Optional argument. Takes an `  INT64  ` value, which represents the size of the dictionary, excluding the unknown term. The `  top_k  ` terms that appear in the most documents are added to the dictionary until this threshold is met. For example, if this value is `  20  ` , the top 20 unique terms that appear in the most documents are added and then no additional terms are added.
  - `  frequency_threshold  ` : Optional argument. Takes an `  INT64  ` value that represents the minimum number of documents a term must appear in to be included in the dictionary. For example, if this value is `  3  ` , a term must appear at least three times in the tokenized document to be added to the dictionary.

Terms are added to a dictionary of terms if they satisfy the criteria for `  top_k  ` and `  frequency_threshold  ` , otherwise they are considered the *unknown term* . The unknown term is always the first term in the dictionary and represented as `  0  ` . The rest of the dictionary is ordered alphabetically.

## Output

`  ML.BAG_OF_WORDS  ` returns a value for every row in the input. Each value has the following type:

`  ARRAY<STRUCT<index INT64, value FLOAT64>>  `

Definitions:

  - `  index  ` : The index of the term that was added to the dictionary. Unknown terms have an index of `  0  ` .
  - `  value  ` : The corresponding counts in the document.

## Quotas

See [Cloud AI service functions quotas and limits](/bigquery/quotas#cloud_ai_service_functions) .

## Example

The following example calls the `  ML.BAG_OF_WORDS  ` function on an input column `  f  ` , with no unknown terms:

``` text
WITH ExampleTable AS (
  SELECT 1 AS id, ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c'] AS f
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS id, ['a', 'c'] AS f
)

SELECT ML.BAG_OF_WORDS(f, 32, 1) OVER() AS results
FROM ExampleTable
ORDER BY id;
```

The output is similar to the following:

``` text
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id |                                        results                                        |
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  1 | [{"index":"1","value":"1.0"},{"index":"2","value":"2.0"},{"index":"3","value":"1.0"}] |
|  2 |                             [{"index":"1","value":"1.0"},{"index":"3","value":"1.0"}] |
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Notice that there is no index `  0  ` in the result, as there are no unknown terms.

The following example calls the `  ML.BAG_OF_WORDS  ` function on an input column `  f  ` :

``` text
WITH ExampleTable AS (
  SELECT 1 AS id, ['a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'd'] AS f
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS id, ['a', 'c', NULL] AS f
)

SELECT ML.BAG_OF_WORDS(f, 4, 2) OVER() AS results
FROM ExampleTable
ORDER BY id;
```

The output is similar to the following:

``` text
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id |                                        results                                        |
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  1 | [{"index":"0","value":"5.0"},{"index":"1","value":"1.0"},{"index":"2","value":"4.0"}] |
|  2 | [{"index":"0","value":"1.0"},{"index":"1","value":"1.0"},{"index":"2","value":"1.0"}] |
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
```

Notice that the values for `  b  ` and `  d  ` are not returned as they appear in only one document when the value of `  frequency_threshold  ` is set to `  2  ` .

The following example calls the `  ML.BAG_OF_WORDS  ` function with a lower value of `  top_k  ` :

``` text
WITH ExampleTable AS (
  SELECT 1 AS id, ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c'] AS f
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS id, ['a', 'c', 'c'] AS f
)

SELECT ML.BAG_OF_WORDS(f, 2, 1) OVER() AS results
FROM ExampleTable
ORDER BY id;
```

The output is similar to the following:

``` text
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id |                                        results                                        |
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  1 | [{"index":"0","value":"2.0"},{"index":"1","value":"1.0"},{"index":"2","value":"1.0"}] |
|  2 |                             [{"index":"1","value":"1.0"},{"index":"2","value":"2.0"}] |
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 
```

Notice how the value for `  b  ` is not returned since we specify we want the top two terms, and `  b  ` only appears in one document.

The following example contains two terms with the same frequency. One of the terms is excluded from the results due to the alphabetical order.

``` text
WITH ExampleData AS (
  SELECT 1 AS id, ['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd'] as f
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS id, ['a', 'c', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd'] as f
)

SELECT id, ML.BAG_OF_WORDS(f, 2 ,2) OVER() as result
FROM ExampleData
ORDER BY id;
```

The results look like the following:

``` text
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id |                                         result                                        |
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  1 | [{"index":"0","value":"5.0"},{"index":"1","value":"1.0"},{"index":"2","value":"1.0"}] |
|  2 | [{"index":"0","value":"3.0"},{"index":"1","value":"1.0"},{"index":"2","value":"2.0"}] |
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
