# The ML.ANNOTATE\_IMAGE function

This document describes the `  ML.ANNOTATE_IMAGE  ` function, which lets you annotate images that are stored in BigQuery [object tables](/bigquery/docs/object-table-introduction) by using the [Cloud Vision API](/vision) .

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.ANNOTATE_IMAGE(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL_NAME`,
  TABLE `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.OBJECT_TABLE`,
  STRUCT( [VISION_FEATURES] AS vision_features )
)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.ANNOTATE_IMAGE  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the project that contains the resource.

  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the resource.

  - `  MODEL_NAME  ` : the name of a [remote model](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model-service) with a [`  REMOTE_SERVICE_TYPE  ` argument](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model-service#remote_service_type) of `  CLOUD_AI_VISION_V1  ` .

  - `  OBJECT_TABLE  ` : the name of the [object table](/bigquery/docs/object-table-introduction) that contains URIs of the images.

  - `  VISION_FEATURES  ` : a `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` value that specifies one or more feature names of supported Vision API features, in the format `  ['feature_name_1', 'feature_name_2', ...]  ` . The supported features are as follows:
    
      - [`  FACE_DETECTION  `](/vision/docs/detecting-faces)
    
      - [`  LANDMARK_DETECTION  `](/vision/docs/detecting-landmarks)
    
      - [`  LOGO_DETECTION  `](/vision/docs/detecting-logos)
    
      - [`  LABEL_DETECTION  `](/vision/docs/labels)
    
      - [`  TEXT_DETECTION  `](/vision/docs/ocr)
    
      - [`  DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION  `](/vision/docs/pdf)
    
      - [`  IMAGE_PROPERTIES  `](/vision/docs/detecting-properties)
    
      - [`  OBJECT_LOCALIZATION  `](/vision/docs/object-localizer)

## Output

`  ML.ANNOTATE_IMAGE  ` returns the input table plus the following columns:

  - `  ml_annotate_image_result  ` : a `  JSON  ` value that contains the image annotation result from the Vision API.
  - `  ml_annotate_image_status  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the API response status for the corresponding row. This value is empty if the operation was successful.

## Quotas

See [Cloud AI service functions quotas and limits](/bigquery/quotas#cloud_ai_service_functions) .

## Known issues

Sometimes after a query job that uses this function finishes successfully, some returned rows contain the following error message:

``` text
A retryable error occurred: RESOURCE EXHAUSTED error from <remote endpoint>
```

This issue occurs because BigQuery query jobs finish successfully even if the function fails for some of the rows. The function fails when the volume of API calls to the remote endpoint exceeds the quota limits for that service. This issue occurs most often when you are running multiple parallel batch queries. BigQuery retries these calls, but if the retries fail, the `  resource exhausted  ` error message is returned.

To iterate through inference calls until all rows are successfully processed, you can use the [BigQuery remote inference SQL scripts](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/bigquery-ml-utils/tree/master/sql_scripts/remote_inference) or the [BigQuery remote inference pipeline Dataform package](https://github.com/dataform-co/dataform-bqml) .

## Locations

`  ML.ANNOTATE_IMAGE  ` must run in the same region as the remote model that the function references. For more information about supported locations for models based on the Vision API, see [Locations for remote models](/bigquery/docs/locations#locations-for-remote-models) .

## Examples

**Example 1**

The following example performs label detection on the object table `  mytable  ` in `  mydataset  ` :

``` text
# Create model
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL
`myproject.mydataset.myvisionmodel`
REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `myproject.myregion.myconnection`
OPTIONS (remote_service_type = 'cloud_ai_vision_v1');
```

``` text
# Annotate image
SELECT *
FROM ML.ANNOTATE_IMAGE(
  MODEL `mydataset.myvisionmodel`,
  TABLE `mydataset.mytable`,
  STRUCT(['label_detection'] AS vision_features)
);
```

The result is similar to the following:

``` text
ml_annotate_image_result  | ml_annotate_image_status | uri | generation | content_type |  size   |  md5_hash  |  updated | metadata |
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
{"label_annotations":[{"description":"Food","mid":"/m/02wbm","score":0.97591567,"topicality":0.97591567}]}  | | gs://my-bucket/images/Cheeseburger.jpg | 1661921874516197 | image/jpeg   |  174600 | a259a5076c22696848a1bc10b7162cc2 | 2022-08-31 04:57:54 | []
```

**Example 2**

The following example annotates images in the object table `  mytable  ` , selects the rows where the detected label is `  food  ` and the score is higher than `  0.97  ` , and then returns the results in separate columns:

``` text
CREATE TABLE
  `mydataset.label_score` AS (
  SELECT
    uri AS `Input image path`,
    STRING(ml_annotate_image_result.label_annotations[0].description) AS `Detected label`,
    FLOAT64(ml_annotate_image_result.label_annotations[0].score) AS Score,
    FLOAT64(ml_annotate_image_result.label_annotations[0].topicality) AS Topicality,
    ml_annotate_image_status AS Status
  FROM
    ML.ANNOTATE_IMAGE( MODEL `mydataset.myvisionmodel`,
      TABLE `mydataset.mytable`,
      STRUCT(['label_detection'] AS vision_features))
  );

SELECT
  *
FROM
  `mydataset.label_score`
WHERE
  `Detected label` ='Food'
  AND Score > 0.97;
```

The result is similar to the following:

``` text
Input image path  | Detected label | Score | Topicality | Status |
------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------
gs://my-bucket/images/Cheeseburger.jpg | Food |  0.97591567 | 0.97591567 | |
```

If you get an error like `  query limit exceeded  ` , you might have exceeded the [quota](/bigquery/quotas#cloud_ai_service_functions) for this function, which can leave you with unprocessed rows. Use the following query to complete processing the unprocessed rows:

``` text
CREATE TABLE
  `mydataset.label_score_next` AS (
  SELECT
    uri AS `Input image path`,
    STRING(ml_annotate_image_result.label_annotations[0].description) AS `Detected label`,
    FLOAT64(ml_annotate_image_result.label_annotations[0].score) AS Score,
    FLOAT64(ml_annotate_image_result.label_annotations[0].topicality) AS Topicality,
    ml_annotate_image_status AS Status
  FROM
    ML.ANNOTATE_IMAGE( MODEL `mydataset.myvisionmodel`,
      TABLE `mydataset.mytable`,
      STRUCT(['label_detection'] AS vision_features))
  WHERE uri NOT IN (
    SELECT `Input image path` FROM `mydataset.label_score`
    WHERE STATUS = '')
  );

SELECT * FROM `mydataset.label_score_next`;
```
