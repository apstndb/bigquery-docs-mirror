# The ML.GET\_INSIGHTS function

This document describes the `  ML.GET_INSIGHTS  ` function, which you can use to retrieve information about changes to key metrics in your multi-dimensional data from a [contribution analysis](/bigquery/docs/contribution-analysis) model. You can use a [`  CREATE MODEL  ` statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-contribution-analysis) to create a contribution analysis model in BigQuery.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.GET_INSIGHTS(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL_NAME`
)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.GET_INSIGHTS  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : Your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` : The BigQuery dataset that contains the model.
  - `  MODEL_NAME  ` : The name of the contribution analysis model.

## Output

Some of the `  ML.GET_INSIGHTS  ` output columns contain metrics that compare the values for a given segment in either the test or control dataset against the values for the *population* , which is all segments in the same dataset. The metric values calculated for the entire population except for the given segment are referred to as *complement* values.

### Output for summable metric contribution analysis models

`  ML.GET_INSIGHTS  ` returns the following output columns for contribution analysis models that use [summable metrics](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-contribution-analysis#use_a_summable_metric) , in addition to the dimension columns:

  - `  contributors  ` : an `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` value that contains the dimension values for a given segment. The other output metrics that are returned in the same row apply to the segment described by these dimensions.

  - `  metric_test  ` : a numeric value that contains the sum of the value of the metric column in the test dataset for the given segment. The metric column is specified in the `  CONTRIBUTION_METRIC  ` option of the contribution analysis model.
    
    `  SUM(metric_column_name) WHERE is_test_col = TRUE  `

  - `  metric_control  ` : a numeric value that contains the sum of the value of the metric column in the control dataset for the given segment. The metric column is specified in the `  CONTRIBUTION_METRIC  ` option of the contribution analysis model.
    
    `  SUM(metric_column_name) WHERE is_test_col = FALSE  `

  - `  difference  ` : a numeric value that contains the difference between the `  metric_test  ` and `  metric_control  ` values:
    
    `  metric_test - metric_control  `

  - `  relative_difference  ` : a numeric value that contains the relative change in the segment value between the test and control datasets:
    
    `  difference / metric_control  `

  - `  unexpected_difference  ` : a numeric value that contains the unexpected difference between the segment's actual `  metric_test  ` value and the segment's expected `  metric_test  ` value, which is determined by comparing the ratio of change for this segment against the complement ratio of change. The `  unexpected_difference  ` value is calculated as follows:
    
    1.  Determine the `  metric_test  ` value for all segments except the given segment, referred to here as `  complement_test_change  ` :
        
        `  complement_test_change = sum(metric_test for the population) - metric_test  `
    
    2.  Determine the `  metric_control  ` value for all segments except the given segment, referred to here as `  complement_control_change  ` :
        
        `  complement_control_change = sum(metric_control for the population) - metric_control  `
    
    3.  Determine the ratio between the `  complement_test_change  ` and `  complement_control_change  ` values, referred to here as `  complement_change_ratio  ` :
        
        `  complement_change_ratio = complement_test_change / complement_control_change  `
    
    4.  Determine the expected `  metric_test  ` value for the given segment, referred to here as `  expected_metric_test  ` :
        
        `  expected_metric_test = metric_control * complement_change_ratio  `
    
    5.  Determine the `  unexpected_difference  ` value:
        
        `  unexpected_difference = metric_test - expected_metric_test  `

  - `  relative_unexpected_difference  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the `  unexpected_difference  ` value and the `  expected_metric_test  ` value:
    
    `  unexpected_difference / expected_metric_test  `
    
    You can use the `  relative_unexpected_difference  ` value to determine if the change to this segment is smaller than expected compared to the change in all of the other segments.

  - `  apriori_support  ` : a numeric value that contains the apriori support value for the segment. The apriori support value is either the ratio between the `  metric_test  ` value for the segment and the `  metric_test  ` value for the population, or the ratio between the `  metric_control  ` value for the segment and the `  metric_control  ` value for the population, whichever is greater. The calculation is expressed as the following:
    
    ``` text
    GREATEST(
      metric_test / SUM(metric_test for the population),
      metric_control / SUM(metric_control for the population)
    )
    ```
    
    If the `  apriori_support  ` value is less than the [apriori support threshold](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-contribution-analysis#use_an_apriori_support_threshold) value specified in the model, then the segment is considered too small to be of interest and is excluded by the model.

  - `  contribution  ` : a numeric value that contains the absolute value of the `  difference  ` value: `  ABS(difference)  ` .

Insights are automatically ordered by contribution in descending order to determine the contributors associated with the largest differences in your data between the test and control sets.

### Output for summable ratio metric contribution analysis models

`  ML.GET_INSIGHTS  ` returns the following output columns for contribution analysis models that use [summable ratio metrics](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-contribution-analysis#use_a_summable_ratio_metric) , in addition to the dimension columns:

  - `  contributors  ` : an `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` value that contains the dimension values for a given segment. The other output metrics that are returned in the same row apply to the segment described by these dimensions.

  - `  metric_test  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the two metrics that you are evaluating, in the test dataset for the given metric. These two metrics are specified in the [`  CONTRIBUTION_METRIC  ` option](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-contribution-analysis#contribution_metric) of the contribution analysis model. The `  metric_test  ` value is calculated as the following:
    
    `  sum(numerator_metric_column_name) / sum(denominator_metric_column_name) WHERE is_test_col = TRUE  `

  - `  metric_control  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the two metrics that you are evaluating, in the control dataset for the given metric. These two metrics are specified in the [`  CONTRIBUTION_METRIC  ` option](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-contribution-analysis#contribution_metric) of the contribution analysis model. The `  metric_control  ` value is calculated as the following:
    
    `  SUM(numerator_metric_column_name) / SUM(denominator_metric_column_name) WHERE is_test_col = FALSE  `

  - `  metric_test_over_metric_control  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the `  metric_test  ` value and the `  metric_control  ` value:
    
    `  metric_test / metric_control  `

  - `  metric_test_over_complement  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the `  metric_test  ` value for this segment and the complement `  metric_test  ` value:
    
    `  metric_test / SUM(metric_test for the complement)  `
    
    You can use the `  metric_test_over_complement  ` value to compare the size of this segment to the size the other segments.
    
    For example, consider the following table of test data:
    
    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    <col style="width: 20%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>dim1<br />
    </th>
    <th>dim2<br />
    </th>
    <th>dim3<br />
    </th>
    <th>metric_a<br />
    </th>
    <th>metric_b<br />
    </th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>1<br />
    </td>
    <td>10<br />
    </td>
    <td>20<br />
    </td>
    <td>50<br />
    </td>
    <td>100<br />
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>1<br />
    </td>
    <td>15<br />
    </td>
    <td>30<br />
    </td>
    <td>75<br />
    </td>
    <td>200<br />
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>5<br />
    </td>
    <td>20<br />
    </td>
    <td>40<br />
    </td>
    <td>1<br />
    </td>
    <td>10<br />
    </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    Assume that the `  CONTRIBUTION_METRIC  ` value is `  SUM(metric_a) / SUM(metric_b)  ` . Using the data in the preceding table, the `  metric_a  ` value for the population is `  126  ` , while the `  metric_b  ` value for the population is `  310  ` . The `  metric_test_over_complement  ` value for the segment in the first row of the table is calculated as the following:
    
    `  (50/100)/((75+1)/(200+10)) = .5/(76/210) = 1.38  `
    
    This `  metric_test_over_complement  ` value indicates that the size of this segment is larger than the size of all of the other segments combined. Alternatively, the `  metric_test_over_complement  ` value for the segment in the third row of table is calculated as the following:
    
    `  (1/10)/((50+75)/(100+200)) = .1/(125/300) = 0.24  `
    
    This `  metric_test_over_complement  ` value indicates that the size of this segment is smaller than the combined size of the rest of the segments.

  - `  metric_control_over_complement  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the `  metric_control  ` value for this segment and the complement `  metric_control  ` value:
    
    `  metric_control / sum(metric_control for the complement)  `
    
    You can use the `  metric_control_over_complement  ` value to compare the size of this segment to the size of the other segments.

  - `  aumann_shapley_attribution  ` : a numeric value that contains the [Aumann-Shapley value](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley_value#Aumann%E2%80%93Shapley_value) for this segment. The Aumann-Shapley value measures the contribution of the segment ratio relative to the population ratio. You can use the Aumann-Shapley value to determine [how much a feature contributes to the prediction value](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/8a20a8621978632d76c43dfd28b67767-Paper.pdf) . In the context of contribution analysis, BigQuery ML uses the Aumann-Shapley value to measure the attribution of the segment relative to the population. When calculating this measurement, the service considers the segment ratio changes and the complement population changes between the test and control datasets.

  - `  apriori_support  ` : a numeric value that contains the apriori support value for the segment. The apriori support value is calculated using the numerator column specified in the model's `  CONTRIBUTION_METRIC  ` option:
    
    `  numerator column value for the given segment / SUM(numerator column value for the population)  `
    
    If the `  apriori_support  ` value is less than the [apriori support threshold](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-contribution-analysis#use_an_apriori_support_threshold) value specified in the model, then the segment is considered too small to be of interest and is excluded by the model.

  - `  contribution  ` : a numeric value that contains the absolute value of the `  aumann_shapley_attribution  ` :
    
    `  ABS(aumann_shapley_attribution)  `

Insights are automatically ordered by contribution in descending order to determine the contributors associated with the largest differences in your data between the test and control sets.

### Output for summable by category metric contribution analysis models

`  ML.GET_INSIGHTS  ` returns the following output columns for contribution analysis models that use summable category metrics, in addition to the dimension columns:

  - `  contributors  ` : an `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` value that contains the dimension values for a given segment. The other output metrics that are returned in the same row apply to the segment described by these dimensions.

  - `  metric_test  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the sum of the metric column and the number of distinct values of the count distinct column in the test dataset for a given segment:
    
    `  SUM(sum_column_name) / COUNT(DISTINCT categorical_column_name) WHERE is_test_col = TRUE  `
    
    The metric and count distinct columns are specified in the `  CONTRIBUTION_METRIC  ` option of the contribution analysis model.

  - `  metric_control  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the sum of the metric column and the number of distinct values of the count distinct column in the control dataset for a given segment:
    
    `  SUM(sum_column_name) / COUNT(DISTINCT categorical_column_name) WHERE is_test_col = FALSE  `
    
    The metric and categorical columns are specified in the `  CONTRIBUTION_METRIC  ` option of the contribution analysis model.

  - `  difference  ` : a numeric value that contains the difference between the `  metric_test  ` and `  metric_control  ` values:
    
    `  metric_test - metric_control  ` .

  - `  relative_difference  ` : a numeric value that contains the relative change in the segment value between the test and control datasets:
    
    `  difference/metric_control  `

  - `  metric_test_over_population  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the `  metric_test  ` value for this segment and the `  metric_test  ` value for the population:
    
    `  metric_test / (metric_test for the population)  `
    
    You can use the `  metric_test_over_population  ` value to compare the size of the segment to the overall size of the test dataset.

  - `  metric_control_over_population  ` : a numeric value that contains the ratio between the `  metric_control  ` value for this segment and the `  metric_control  ` value for the population:
    
    `  metric_control / (metric_control for the population)  `
    
    You can use the `  metric_control_over_population  ` value to compare the size of the segment to the overall size of the control dataset.

  - `  apriori_support  ` : a numeric value that contains the apriori support value for the segment. To calculate apriori support, the `  sum_metric_column  ` is used to compute the segment size relative to the population for both the test and control datasets and `  apriori_support  ` is selected as the greater of the two values. The calculation is expressed as the following:
    
    ``` text
    GREATEST(
      SUM(sum_column_name test) / SUM(sum_column_name test for the population),
      SUM(sum_column_name control) / SUM(sum_column_name control for the population)
    )
    ```
    
    If the `  apriori_support  ` value is less than the apriori support threshold value specified in the model, then the segment is considered too small to be of interest and is excluded by the model.

  - `  contribution  ` : a numeric value that contains the absolute value of the difference, calculated as `  ABS(difference)  ` .

Insights are automatically ordered by contribution in descending order to quickly determine the contributors associated with the largest differences in your data between the test and control sets.
