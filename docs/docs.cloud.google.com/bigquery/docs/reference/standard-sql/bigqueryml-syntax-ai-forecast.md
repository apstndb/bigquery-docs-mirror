# The AI.FORECAST function

This document describes the `AI.FORECAST` function, which lets you forecast time series by using the [TimesFM model](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/timesfm-model) that's built into BigQuery ML. You can use this function to perform univariate or multivariate forecasting:

  - **Univariate forecasting** : predicts future values of a single time series based only on its own past values.
  - **Multivariate forecasting** : predicts future values based on the time series' past values and additional variables (covariates) that might influence the forecast.

For example, imagine you have a table containing sales data for a product. You could run a query similar to the following to forecast sales for the next 30 data points:

    SELECT *
    FROM AI.FORECAST(
      TABLE `mydataset.input_table`,
      data_col => 'units_sold',
      timestamp_col => 'sales_date',
      horizon => 30);

## Syntax

The syntax for `AI.FORECAST` depends on if you're performing univariate or multivariate forecasting.

### Univariate

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  AI.FORECAST(
    { TABLE TABLE | (QUERY_STATEMENT) },
    data_col => 'DATA_COL',
    timestamp_col => 'TIMESTAMP_COL'
    [, model => 'MODEL']
    [, id_cols => ID_COLS]
    [, horizon => HORIZON]
    [, forecast_end_timestamp => FORECAST_END_TIMESTAMP]
    [, confidence_level => CONFIDENCE_LEVEL]
    [, output_historical_time_series => OUTPUT_HISTORICAL_TIME_SERIES]
    [, context_window => CONTEXT_WINDOW]
  )
```

#### Arguments

`AI.FORECAST` takes the following arguments for univariate forecasting:

  - `  TABLE  ` : the name of the table that contains the data that you want to forecast. For example, `` `mydataset.mytable` `` .
    
    If the table is in a different project, then you must prepend the project ID to the table name in the following format, including backticks:
    
    `` ` PROJECT_ID . DATASET . TABLE ` ``
    
    For example, `` `myproject.mydataset.mytable` `` .
    
    To prevent query errors, we recommend providing the fully qualified table name, including backticks. This is especially important if the project name contains characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores.

  - `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` : the GoogleSQL query that generates the data that you want to forecast. See the [GoogleSQL query syntax](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#sql_syntax) page for the supported SQL syntax of the `QUERY_STATEMENT` clause.

  - `  DATA_COL  ` : a `STRING` value that specifies the name of the data column. The data column contains the data to forecast. The data column must use one of the following data types:
    
      - `INT64`
      - `NUMERIC`
      - `BIGNUMERIC`
      - `FLOAT64`

  - `  TIMESTAMP_COL  ` : a `STRING` value that specifies the name of the timestamp column. The timestamp column must use one of the following data types:
    
      - `TIMESTAMP`
      - `DATE`
      - `DATETIME`

  - `  MODEL  ` : a `STRING` value that specifies the name of the model to use. Supported models include `TimesFM 2.0` , `TimesFM 2.5` , and `TimesFM 3.0` ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ). The default value is `TimesFM 2.5` .

  - `  ID_COLS  ` : an `ARRAY<STRING>` value that specifies the names of one or more ID columns. Each unique combination of IDs identifies a unique time series to forecast. Specify one or more values for this argument in order to forecast multiple time series using a single query. The columns that you specify must use one of the following data types:
    
      - `STRING`
      - `INT64`
      - `ARRAY<STRING>`
      - `ARRAY<INT64>`

  - `  HORIZON  ` : an `INT64` value that specifies the number of time series data points to forecast. The default value is `10` . The valid input range for the `TimesFM 2.0` and `TimesFM 2.5` models is `[1, 10,000]` . The valid input range for the `TimesFM 3.0` model is `[1, 1024]` . This argument can't be used with the `forecast_end_timestamp` argument.

  - `  FORECAST_END_TIMESTAMP  ` : a timestamp literal value that specifies the end timestamp for the forecasted values. The horizon is calculated based on the end timestamp and the frequency provided from the input table for each time series. If the calculated horizon is out of the valid range `[1, 10,000]` , the query returns an error. You can then adjust the `forecast_end_timestamp` value so that the calculated horizon is within the valid range. This argument can't be used with the `horizon` argument.

  - `  CONFIDENCE_LEVEL  ` : a `FLOAT64` value that specifies the percentage of the future values that fall in the prediction interval. The default value is `0.95` . The valid input range is `[0, 1)` .

  - `  OUTPUT_HISTORICAL_TIME_SERIES  ` : a `BOOL` value that determines whether the input data is returned along with the forecasted data. Set this argument to `TRUE` to return input data. The default value is `FALSE` .
    
    Returning the input data along with the forecasted data lets you compare the historical value of the data column with the forecasted value of the data column, or chart the change in the data column values over time.

  - `  CONTEXT_WINDOW  ` : an `INT64` value that specifies the context window length used by BigQuery ML's built-in TimesFM model. The context window length determines how many of the most recent data points from the input time series are used by the model. For example, if your time series date range is March 1 to April 15, data points are selected starting at April 15 and working backwards. Valid values for models are as follows:
    
    | **Model name** | **Supported context window length**                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `TimesFM 2.0`  | 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048                           |
    | `TimesFM 2.5`  | 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 15360        |
    | `TimesFM 3.0`  | `n * 32` where `n` is an integer in the range `[2, 64]` |
    

    If you don't specify a `CONTEXT_WINDOW` value with the `TimesFM 2.0` or `TimesFM 2.5` models, the `AI.FORECAST` function automatically chooses the smallest possible context window length to use that is still large enough to cover the number of time series data points in your input data. If you don't specify a `CONTEXT_WINDOW` value when you use the `TimesFM 3.0` model, the `AI.FORECAST` function defaults to the maximum supported size, `2048` . The following table shows the relationships between the number of time series data points in the input data, the selected context window length and the corresponding supported TimesFM model name:
    
    | **Number of time series data points** | **Context window length** | **Supported model names**                     |
    | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
    | `(1, 64]`                             | 64                        | `TimesFM 2.0` , `TimesFM 2.5` , `TimesFM 3.0` |
    | `(65, 128]`                           | 128                       | `TimesFM 2.0` , `TimesFM 2.5` , `TimesFM 3.0` |
    | `(129, 256]`                          | 256                       | `TimesFM 2.0` , `TimesFM 2.5` , `TimesFM 3.0` |
    | `(257, 512]`                          | 512                       | `TimesFM 2.0` , `TimesFM 2.5` , `TimesFM 3.0` |
    | `(513, 1024]`                         | 1,024                     | `TimesFM 2.0` , `TimesFM 2.5` , `TimesFM 3.0` |
    | `(1025, 2048]`                        | 2,048                     | `TimesFM 2.0` , `TimesFM 2.5` , `TimesFM 3.0` |
    | `(2049, 4096]`                        | 4,096                     | `TimesFM 2.5`                                 |
    | `(4097, 8192]`                        | 8,192                     | `TimesFM 2.5`                                 |
    | `(8193, 15360]`                       | 15,360                    | `TimesFM 2.5`                                 |
    | `15360`                               | 15,360                    | `TimesFM 2.5`                                 |
    

    For the `TimesFM 2.0` and `TimesFM 3.0` models, 2,048 is the maximum number of time series data points that are passed to the model. For the `TimesFM 2.5` model, 15,360 is the maximum number of time series data points that are passed to the model. Any additional time series data points in the input data are ignored.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM AI.FORECAST(
  { TABLE TABLE | (QUERY_STATEMENT) },
  target_cols => [TARGET_COLS],
  timestamp_col => 'TIMESTAMP_COL',
  model => 'MODEL'
  [, id_cols => [ID_COLS]]
  [, horizon => HORIZON]
  [, confidence_level => CONFIDENCE_LEVEL]

  [, future_covariate_cols => [FUTURE_COVARIATE_COLS]]
  [, output_historical_time_series => OUTPUT_HISTORICAL_TIME_SERIES]
);
```

#### Arguments

`AI.FORECAST` takes the following arguments for multivariate forecasting:

  - `  TABLE  ` : the name of the table that contains the data that you want to forecast. For example, `` `mydataset.mytable` `` .
    
    If the table is in a different project, then you must prepend the project ID to the table name in the following format, including backticks:
    
    `` ` PROJECT_ID . DATASET . TABLE ` ``
    
    For example, `` `myproject.mydataset.mytable` `` .
    
    To prevent query errors, we recommend providing the fully qualified table name, including backticks. This is especially important if the project name contains characters other than letters, numbers, and underscores.

  - `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` : the GoogleSQL query that generates the data that you want to forecast. See the [GoogleSQL query syntax](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#sql_syntax) page for the supported SQL syntax of the `QUERY_STATEMENT` clause.

  - `  TARGET_COLS  ` : an `ARRAY<STRING>` value that specifies the names of the data columns. The data columns contain the data to forecast. The data columns must use one of the following data types:
    
      - `INT64`
      - `NUMERIC`
      - `BIGNUMERIC`
      - `FLOAT64`

  - `  TIMESTAMP_COL  ` : a `STRING` value that specifies the name of the timestamp column. The timestamp column must use one of the following data types:
    
      - `TIMESTAMP`
      - `DATE`
      - `DATETIME`

  - `  MODEL  ` : a `STRING` value that specifies the name of the model to use. You must use the `TimesFM 3.0` model ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ) for multivariate forecasting.

  - PAST\_COVARIATE\_COLS : an `ARRAY<STRING>` value that specifies the names of columns that could influence the target columns and that are only known historically. For example, if you're forecasting daily sales at a store's location, then a past covariate column could be the number of customers who visited the store each day. Customer counts are known historically and can influence sales, but they aren't known for the future. The columns that you specify must use one of the following data types:
    
      - `INT64`
      - `FLOAT64`
      - `NUMERIC`
      - `BIGNUMERIC`

  - FUTURE\_COVARIATE\_COLS : an `ARRAY<STRING>` value that specifies the names of columns that could influence the target columns and are known for both the past and the future. For example, if you're forecasting daily sales at a store's location, then a future covariate column could be whether or not the day is a weekend. This data is known in advance for both the past and the future. The columns that you specify must use one of the following data types:
    
      - `INT64`
      - `FLOAT64`
      - `NUMERIC`
      - `BIGNUMERIC`
    
    > **Note:** When you use `FUTURE_COVARIATE_COLS` , *all* input columns must have data spanning the entire `CONTEXT_WINDOW` + `HORIZON` length.

  - `  HORIZON  ` : an `INT64` value that specifies the number of time series data points to forecast. The default value is `10` . The valid input range for the `TimesFM 3.0` model is `[1, 1024]` . This argument can't be used with the `forecast_end_timestamp` argument.

  - `  ID_COLS  ` : an `ARRAY<STRING>` value that specifies the names of one or more ID columns. Each unique combination of IDs identifies a unique time series to forecast. Specify one or more values for this argument in order to forecast multiple time series using a single query. The columns that you specify must use one of the following data types:
    
      - `STRING`
      - `INT64`
      - `ARRAY<STRING>`
      - `ARRAY<INT64>`

  - `  CONFIDENCE_LEVEL  ` : a `FLOAT64` value that specifies the percentage of the future values that fall in the prediction interval. The default value is `0.95` . The valid input range is `[0, 1)` .

  - `  CONTEXT_WINDOW  ` : an `INT64` value that specifies the context window length used by the TimesFM model. The context window length determines how many of the most recent data points from the input time series are used by the model. For example, if your time series date range is March 1 to April 15, data points are selected starting at April 15 and working backwards. Valid values for the `TimesFM 3.0` model are as follows:
    
    | **Model name** | **Supported context window length**                     |
    | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `TimesFM 3.0`  | `n * 32` where `n` is an integer in the range `[2, 64]` |
    

    If you don't specify a `CONTEXT_WINDOW` value when you use the `TimesFM 3.0` model, the `AI.FORECAST` function defaults to the maximum supported size, `2048` .
    
    For the `TimesFM 3.0` model, 2,048 is the maximum number of time series data points that are passed to the model. Any additional time series data points in the input data are ignored.

  - `  OUTPUT_HISTORICAL_TIME_SERIES  ` : a `BOOL` value that determines whether the input data is returned along with the forecasted data. Set this argument to `TRUE` to return input data. The default value is `FALSE` .
    
    Returning the input data along with the forecasted data lets you compare the historical value of the data column with the forecasted value of the data column, or chart the change in the data column values over time.

## Output

The output schema of `AI.FORECAST` depends on if you're performing univariate or multivariate forecasting.

### Univariate

The output schema of `AI.FORECAST` depends on the value of the `output_historical_time_series` argument. The following columns are always part of the output:

  - `id_cols` : one or more values that contain the identifiers of a time series. `id_cols` can be an `INT64` , `STRING` , `ARRAY<INT64>` , or `ARRAY<STRING>` value. The column names and types are inherited from the `ID_COLS` argument value specified in the function input.
  - `confidence_level` : a `FLOAT64` value that contains the `confidence_level` value that you specified in the function input, or `0.95` if you didn't specify a `confidence_level` value. This value is the same across all rows.
  - `prediction_interval_lower_bound` : a `FLOAT64` value that contains the lower bound of the prediction interval for each forecasted point. For historical points, the value is `NULL` .
  - `prediction_interval_upper_bound` : a `FLOAT64` value that contains the upper bound of the prediction interval for each forecasted point. For historical points, the value is `NULL` .
  - `ai_forecast_status` : a `STRING` value that contains the forecast status. This value is empty if the operation was successful. If the operation wasn't successful, the value is the error string. A common error is `The time series data is too short.` This error indicates that there wasn't enough historical data in the time series to generate a forecast. A minimum of 3 data points is required.

If you set `output_historical_time_series` to `FALSE` , then the output rows only include forecasted data and the output columns are the following:

  - `forecast_timestamp` : a `TIMESTAMP` value that contains the timestamps of the time series.
  - `forecast_value` : a `FLOAT64` value that contains the 50% quantile value for the forecasting output from the model. The 50% quantile value represents the median value of the forecasted data.

If you set `output_historical_time_series` to `TRUE` , then the output rows include all data, and the output columns are the following:

  - `time_series_type` : a `STRING` value that contains a value of either `history` or `forecast` . Rows that have a value of `history` contain data from the input table or query. Rows that have a value of `forecast` contain forecasted data.
  - `time_series_timestamp` : a `TIMESTAMP` value that contains the timestamps of the time series.
  - `time_series_data` : a `FLOAT64` value that represents the historical input if the `time_series_type` is `history` . Otherwise, if the `time_series_type` is `forecast` this number represents the 50% quantile of the forecast.

### Multivariate

Pre-GA products and features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

If you perform a multivariate forecast, the output schema is restructured to support multiple targets:

  - `id_cols` : one or more values that contain the identifiers of a time series. `id_cols` can be an `INT64` , `STRING` , `ARRAY<INT64>` , or `ARRAY<STRING>` value. The column names and types are inherited from the `ID_COLS` argument value specified in the function input.

  - `timestamp_col` : a `TIMESTAMP` value that contains the timestamp of the data point. Unlike univariate, this column preserves the name of the timestamp column from your input table—for example, `date` .

  - `target_cols` : for each target column specified in `TARGET_COLS` input argument, the output contains a `STRUCT` type with the following fields:
    
      - `value` : a `FLOAT64` value that contains the 50% quantile value for the forecasting output from the model. The 50% quantile value represents the median value of the forecasted data.
    
      - `prediction_interval_lower_bound` : a `FLOAT64` value that contains the lower bound of the prediction interval for each forecasted point. For historical points, the value is `NULL` .
    
      - `prediction_interval_upper_bound` : a `FLOAT64` value that contains the upper bound of the prediction interval for each forecasted point. For historical points, the value is `NULL` .

  - `time_series_type` : a `STRING` value that contains a value of either `history` or `forecast` . Rows that have a value of `history` contain data from the input table or query. Rows that have a value of `forecast` contain forecasted data.

  - `confidence_level` : a `FLOAT64` value that contains the `confidence_level` value that you specified in the function input, or `0.95` if you didn't specify a `confidence_level` value. This value is the same across all rows.

  - `ai_forecast_status` : a `STRING` value that contains the forecast status. This value is empty if the operation was successful. If the operation failed, the value is the error string. A common error is `The time series data is too short.` This error indicates that there wasn't enough historical data in the time series to generate a forecast. A minimum of 3 data points is required.

## Examples

The following examples show how to perform univariate and multivariate forecasting.

### Univariate forecasting

The following example performs univariate forecasting to predict the daily number of bike trips for each different user type for the next 30 days:

    WITH
      citibike_trips AS (
        SELECT EXTRACT(DATE FROM starttime) AS date, usertype, COUNT(*) AS num_trips
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
        GROUP BY date, usertype
      )
    SELECT *
    FROM
      AI.FORECAST(
        TABLE citibike_trips,
        data_col => 'num_trips',
        timestamp_col => 'date',
        id_cols => ['usertype'],
        horizon => 30);

The result is similar to the following:

    +------------+-------------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+--------------------+
    | usertype   | forecast_timestamp      | forecast_value | confidence_level | prediction_interval_lower_bound | prediction_interval_upper_bound | ai_forecast_status |
    +------------+-------------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+--------------------+
    | Subscriber | 2016-10-01 00:00:00 UTC | 21225.859375   | 0.95             | -3706.6855220930775             | 46158.404272093074              |                    |
    | Subscriber | 2016-10-02 00:00:00 UTC | 25503.98046875 | 0.95             | 1723.3565528871222              | 49284.604384612874              |                    |
    | ...        | ...                     | ...            | ...              | ...                             | ...                             | ...                |
    +------------+-------------------------+----------------+------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+--------------------+

### Univariate forecasting with historical data output

The following example performs univariate forecasting to predict the daily number of bike trips for each different user type, the `output_historical_time_series` argument is set to `TRUE` , so the output includes historical and forecasted data.

    WITH
      citibike_trips AS (
        SELECT EXTRACT(DATE FROM starttime) AS date, usertype, COUNT(*) AS num_trips
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
        GROUP BY date, usertype
      )
    SELECT *
    FROM
      AI.FORECAST(
        TABLE citibike_trips,
        data_col => 'num_trips',
        timestamp_col => 'date',
        id_cols => ['usertype'],
        horizon => 30,
        output_historical_time_series => true);

The result is similar to the following:

    +----------+------------------+-------------------------+------------------+------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+--------------------+
    | usertype | time_series_type | time_series_timestamp   | time_series_data | confidence_level | prediction_interval_lower_bound | prediction_interval_upper_bound | ai_forecast_status |

### Multivariate forecasting

The following example performs multivariate forecasting to predict the daily number of bike trips and their average duration for the next 30 days:

    WITH
      citibike_trips AS (
        SELECT EXTRACT(DATE FROM starttime) AS date, usertype, COUNT(*) AS num_trips, AVG(tripduration) AS avg_duration
        FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
        GROUP BY date, usertype
      )
    SELECT
      FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', date) AS date,
      num_trips.value AS num_trips,
      num_trips.prediction_interval_lower_bound AS trips_lb,
      num_trips.prediction_interval_upper_bound AS trips_ub,
      avg_duration.value AS avg_duration_forecast,
      avg_duration.prediction_interval_lower_bound AS duration_lb,
      avg_duration.prediction_interval_upper_bound AS duration_ub,
    FROM
      AI.FORECAST(
        TABLE citibike_trips,
        target_cols => ['num_trips', 'avg_duration'],
        timestamp_col => 'date',
        model => 'TimesFM 3.0',
        horizon => 30);

The result is similar to the following, with values rounded for clarity. It includes the forecasted values for the next 30 days, as well as the lower and upper bounds for the prediction intervals:

    +------------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------------------+-------------+-------------+
    | date       | num_trips | trips_lb | trips_ub | avg_duration_forecast | duration_lb | duration_ub |
    +------------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------------------+-------------+-------------+
    | 2016-10-01 | 17252     | 2792     | 25973    | 1243                  | 1064        | 1511        |
    | 2016-10-02 | 20303     | 7130     | 29752    | 1271                  | 1081        | 1554        |
    | ...        | ...       | ...      | ...      | ...                   | ...         | ...         |
    +------------+-----------+----------+----------+-----------------------+-------------+-------------+

### Multivariate forecasting with past and future covariates

The following example performs multivariate forecasting to predict daily bike trips for subscribers and unsubscribed (casual) users. The query uses the average trip duration as a past covariate because this value is not available for the future. The query uses whether the date is a weekend as a future covariate because the day of the week is known in advance.

    WITH data AS (
      SELECT
        DATE(starttime) AS dt,
        -- Set target columns to NULL for future dates to be forecasted.
        IF(MIN(starttime) < '2016-06-01', COUNTIF(usertype = 'Subscriber'), NULL) AS subscriber_trips,
        IF(MIN(starttime) < '2016-06-01', COUNTIF(usertype = 'Customer'), NULL) AS casual_trips,
        -- Define the past covariate on historical dates and assign it to NULL for future dates.
        IF(MIN(starttime) < '2016-06-01', AVG(tripduration / 60.0), NULL) AS avg_duration_min,
        -- Define the future covariate on historical and future dates.
        IF(EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM MIN(starttime)) IN (1, 7), 1.0, 0.0) AS is_weekend
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.new_york.citibike_trips`
      WHERE starttime >= '2016-01-01' AND starttime < '2016-06-08'
      GROUP BY dt
    )
    SELECT
      FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m-%d', dt) AS trip_date,
      subscriber_trips.value AS total_subscriber_trips,
      casual_trips.value AS total_casual_trips
    FROM
      AI.FORECAST(
        TABLE data,
        MODEL => 'TimesFM 3.0',
        TIMESTAMP_COL => 'dt',
        TARGET_COLS => ['subscriber_trips', 'casual_trips'],
        PAST_COVARIATE_COLS => ['avg_duration_min'],
        FUTURE_COVARIATE_COLS => ['is_weekend']
      );

The result is similar to the following, with values rounded for clarity. There is a significant increase in the number of forecasted casual trips on June 4 and June 5, which are weekend days.

    +------------+------------------------+--------------------+
    | trip_date  | total_subscriber_trips | total_casual_trips |
    +------------+------------------------+--------------------+
    | 2016-06-01 | 44699                  | 4581               |
    | 2016-06-02 | 44611                  | 4647               |
    | 2016-06-03 | 41379                  | 5341               |
    | 2016-06-04 | 30164                  | 9097               |
    | 2016-06-05 | 26727                  | 8398               |
    | 2016-06-06 | 36713                  | 4723               |
    | 2016-06-07 | 39749                  | 4180               |
