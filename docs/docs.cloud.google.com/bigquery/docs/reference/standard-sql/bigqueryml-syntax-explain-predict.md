# The ML.EXPLAIN\_PREDICT function

This document describes the `  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` function, which lets you generate a predicted value and a set of feature attributions for each instance of the input data. Feature attributions indicate how much each feature in your model contributed to the final prediction for each given instance. `  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` is essentially an extended version of [`  ML.PREDICT  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-predict) .

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL`,
  { TABLE `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.TABLE` | (QUERY_STATEMENT) },
  STRUCT(
  [MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS AS max_output_tokens]
  [, TOP_K_FEATURES AS top_k_features]
  [, THRESHOLD AS threshold]
  [, INTEGRATED_GRADIENTS_NUM_STEPS AS integrated_gradients_num_steps]
  [, APPROX_FEATURE_CONTRIB AS approx_feature_contrib])
)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the project that contains the resource.

  - `  DATASET  ` : the dataset that contains the resource.

  - `  MODEL  ` : the name of the model.

  - `  TABLE  ` : the name of the input table that contains the data to be evaluated.
    
    If `  TABLE  ` is specified, the input column names in the table must match the column names in the model, and their types should be compatible according to BigQuery [implicit coercion rules](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conversion_rules#coercion) .
    
    If there are unused columns from the table, they are passed through to the output columns.

  - `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` : the GoogleSQL query that is used to generate the evaluation data. For the supported SQL syntax for the `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` clause in GoogleSQL, see [Query syntax](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#sql_syntax) .
    
    If `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` is specified, the input column names from the query must match the column names in the model, and their types should be compatible according to BigQuery [implicit coercion rules](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conversion_rules#coercion) .
    
    If there are unused columns from the table, they are passed through to the output columns.
    
    If you used the [`  TRANSFORM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform) in the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement that created the model, then only the input columns present in the `  TRANSFORM  ` clause can appear in `  QUERY_STATEMENT  ` .

  - `  TOP_K_FEATURES  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies how many top feature attribution pairs are generated for each row of input data. The features are ranked by the absolute values of their attributions.
    
    By default, `  TOP_K_FEATURES  ` is set to `  5  ` . If its value is greater than the number of features in the training data, the attributions of all features are returned.

  - `  THRESHOLD  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that specifies the cutoff between the two labels for binary classification models. Predictions above the threshold are positive predictions. Predictions below the threshold are negative predictions. Feature attributions are returned only for the predicted label.
    
    The `  THRESHOLD  ` value must be between `  0.0  ` and `  1.0  ` . The default value is `  0.5  ` .

  - `  INTEGRATED_GRADIENTS_NUM_STEPS  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies the number of steps to sample between the example being explained and its baseline. This value is used to approximate the integral in [integrated gradients](/vertex-ai/docs/explainable-ai/overview#integrated-gradients) attribution methods. Increasing the value improves the precision of feature attributions, but can be slower and more computationally expensive.
    
    This option only applies to [deep neural network (DNN) models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-dnn-models) , which use integrated gradients attribution methods. The default value is `  15  ` .

  - `  APPROX_FEATURE_CONTRIB  ` : a `  BOOL  ` value that indicates whether to use an approximate feature contribution method in the XGBoost model explanation. This option applies only to [boosted tree](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-boosted-tree) and [random forest](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-random-forest) models.
    
    This capability is provided by the XGBoost library; BigQuery ML only passes this option through to it. For more information, see [Package 'xgboost'](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/xgboost.pdf) and search for `  approxcontrib  ` .
    
    The default value is `  FALSE  ` .

## Output

`  ML.EXPLAIN_PREDICT  ` returns the following columns in addition to any passthrough columns:

  - `  predicted_<label_column_name>  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains either the predicted value of the label for regression models or the predicted label class for classification models.

  - `  probability  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the probability of the predicted label class. This column is only present for classification models.

  - `  top_feature_attributions  ` : An `  ARRAY<STRUCT>  ` value that contains the attributions of the top *k* features to the final prediction:
    
      - `  top_feature_attributions.feature  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the feature name.
      - `  top_feature_attributions.attribution  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the attribution of the feature to the final prediction.

  - `  baseline_prediction_value  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains one of the following:
    
      - For linear models, the `  baseline_prediction_value  ` value is the intercept of the model.
      - For DNN models, the `  baseline_prediction_value  ` value is the mean across all numerical features and `  NULL  ` for other types of features.
      - For boosted tree and random forest models, the `  baseline_prediction_value  ` value is equal to the bias term, which is the expected output of the model over the training dataset. See [Tree SHAP documentation](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/tabular_examples/tree_based_models/Understanding%20Tree%20SHAP%20for%20Simple%20Models.html) for more information.

  - `  prediction_value  ` : The raw prediction value.
    
      - For regression models, this is a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the value of the column identified by `  predicted_<label_column_name>  ` .
      - For classification models, this is an `  INT  ` or `  STRING  ` value that contains the [logit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logit) value (also called log-odds) for the predicted class. The predicted class probabilities are obtained by applying the [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) transformation to the logit values.

  - `  approximation_error  ` :
    
      - Exact attribution methods like Tree SHAP are defined as follows:
        
        $$\\frac{|\\texttt{prediction\_value} - \\texttt{baseline\_prediction\_value} - \\sum{\\texttt{feature\_attributions}}|}{|\\texttt{prediction\_value} - \\texttt{baseline\_prediction\_value}|}$$
        
        Because of this explanation of the contributions to the predicted value, there is no approximation error for these types of methods, and this column value is `  0  ` . Exact attribution methods are used for the following types of models:
        
          - [Linear & logistic regression](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-glm)
          - [Boosted tree](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-boosted-tree)
          - [Random forest](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-random-forest)
    
      - Integrated gradients is an approximated attribution method that is defined as follows:
        
        $$\\texttt{baseline\_prediction\_value} + \\sum{\\texttt{feature\_attributions}} = \\texttt{prediction\_value}$$
        
        For integrated gradients, this column value is greater than `  0  ` . The integrated gradients method is used with DNN models.
