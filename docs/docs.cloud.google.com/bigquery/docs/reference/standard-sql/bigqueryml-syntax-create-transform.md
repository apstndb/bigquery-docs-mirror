# The CREATE MODEL statement for transform-only models

This document describes the `  CREATE MODEL  ` statement for creating transform-only models in BigQuery. Transform-only models use the [`  TRANSFORM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform) to apply [preprocessing functions](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) to input data and return the preprocessed data. Transform-only models decouple data preprocessing from model training, making it easier for you to capture and reuse a set of data preprocessing rules.

You can use a transform-only model in conjunction with the [`  ML.TRANSFORM  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-transform) to provide preprocessed data to other models:

  - You can use it in the [query statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#query_statement) when creating another model, in order to use the transformed data as the training data for that model.
  - You can use it in the [`  query statement  ` argument](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-predict#arguments) of the `  ML.PREDICT  ` function, in order to provide data for prediction that is processed in the way the target model expects.

For batch feature transformations, it is better to use transform-only models because it lets you process large amounts of data in a short time. For online feature transformations, it is better to use [Vertex AI Feature Store](/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/overview) because it provides responses with low latency.

You can also use a transform-only model with the [`  ML.FEATURE_INFO  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-feature) in order to return information about feature transformations in the model.

## `     CREATE MODEL    ` syntax

``` sql
{CREATE MODEL | CREATE MODEL IF NOT EXISTS | CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL} model_name
TRANSFORM (select_list)
OPTIONS(MODEL_TYPE = 'TRANSFORM_ONLY')
AS query_statement
```

### `     CREATE MODEL    `

Creates and trains a new model in the specified dataset. If the model name exists, `  CREATE MODEL  ` returns an error.

### `     CREATE MODEL IF NOT EXISTS    `

Creates and trains a new model only if the model doesn't exist in the specified dataset.

### `     CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL    `

Creates and trains a model and replaces an existing model with the same name in the specified dataset.

### `     model_name    `

The name of the model you're creating or replacing. The model name must be unique in the dataset: no other model or table can have the same name. The model name must follow the same naming rules as a BigQuery table. A model name can:

  - Contain up to 1,024 characters
  - Contain letters (upper or lower case), numbers, and underscores

`  model_name  ` is case-sensitive.

If you don't have a default project configured, then you must prepend the project ID to the model name in the following format, including backticks:

\`\[PROJECT\_ID\].\[DATASET\].\[MODEL\]\`

For example, \`myproject.mydataset.mymodel\`.

### `     select_list    `

You can pass columns from `  query_statement  ` through to model training without transformation by either using `  *  ` , `  * EXCEPT()  ` , or by listing the column names directly.

Not all columns from `  query_statement  ` are required to appear in the `  TRANSFORM  ` clause, so you can drop columns appearing in `  query_statement  ` by omitting them from the `  TRANSFORM  ` clause.

You can transform inputs from `  query_statement  ` by using expressions in `  select_list  ` . `  select_list  ` is similar to a normal `  SELECT  ` statement. `  select_list  ` supports the following syntax:

  - `  *  `
  - `  * EXCEPT()  `
  - `  * REPLACE()  `
  - `  expression  `
  - `  expression.*  `

The following cannot appear inside `  select_list  ` :

  - Aggregation functions.
  - Non-BigQuery ML analytic functions. For more information about supported functions, see [Manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) .
  - UDFs.
  - Subqueries.
  - Anonymous columns. For example, `  a + b as c  ` is allowed, while `  a + b  ` isn't.

The output columns of `  select_list  ` can be of any BigQuery supported data type.

If present, the following columns must appear in `  select_list  ` without transformation:

  - `  label  `
  - `  data_split_col  `
  - `  kmeans_init_col  `
  - `  instance_weight_col  `

If these columns are returned by `  query_statement  ` , you must reference them in `  select_list  ` by column name outside of any expression, or by using `  *  ` . You can't use aliases with these columns.

### `     MODEL_TYPE    `

**Syntax**

``` text
MODEL_TYPE = 'TRANSFORM_ONLY'
```

**Description**

Specify the model type. This option is required.

### `     query_statement    `

The [GoogleSQL query](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) that contains the data to preprocess. The statistics that are calculated when transforming this data are applied to the input data of any functions that you use the model with.

## Examples

The following examples show how to create and use transform-only models.

**Example 1**

The following example creates a model named `  transform_model  ` in `  mydataset  ` in your default project. The model transforms several columns from the BigQuery public table `  bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins  ` :

``` text
CREATE MODEL `mydataset.transform_model`
  TRANSFORM(
    species,
    island,
    ML.MAX_ABS_SCALER(culmen_length_mm) OVER () AS culmen_length_mm,
    ML.MAX_ABS_SCALER(culmen_depth_mm) OVER () AS culmen_depth_mm,
    ML.MAX_ABS_SCALER(flipper_length_mm) OVER () AS flipper_length_mm,
    sex,
    body_mass_g)
  OPTIONS (
    model_type = 'transform_only')
AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`
);
```

**Example 2**

The following example creates a model named `  mymodel  ` in `  mydataset  ` in your default project. The model is trained on data that is preprocessed by using a transform-only model:

``` text
CREATE MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`
OPTIONS
  ( MODEL_TYPE = 'LINEAR_REG',
    MAX_ITERATIONS = 5,
    INPUT_LABEL_COLS = ['body_mass_g'] ) AS
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.TRANSFORM(
    MODEL `mydataset.transform_model`,
    TABLE `bigquery-public-data.ml_datasets.penguins`)
WHERE body_mass_g IS NOT NULL;
```
