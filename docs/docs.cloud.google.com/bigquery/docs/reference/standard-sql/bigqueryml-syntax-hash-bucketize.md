# The ML.HASH\_BUCKETIZE function

This document describes the `  ML.HASH_BUCKETIZE  ` function, which lets you convert a string expression to a deterministic hash and then bucketize it by the modulo value of that hash.

You can use this function with models that support [manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) . For more information, see the following documents:

  - [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey)
  - [Contribution analysis user journey](/bigquery/docs/contribution-analysis#contribution_analysis_user_journey)

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.HASH_BUCKETIZE(string_expression, hash_bucket_size)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.HASH_BUCKETIZE  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  string_expression  ` : the `  STRING  ` expression to bucketize.
  - `  hash_bucket_size  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies the number of buckets to create. This value must be greater than or equal to `  0  ` . If `  hash_bucket_size  ` equals `  0  ` , the function only hashes the string without bucketizing the hashed value.

## Output

`  ML.HASH_BUCKETIZE  ` returns an `  INT64  ` value that identifies the bucket.

## Example

The following example bucketizes string expressions into three buckets:

``` text
SELECT
  f, ML.HASH_BUCKETIZE(f, 3) AS bucket
FROM UNNEST(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']) AS f;
```

The output looks similar to the following:

``` console
+---+--------+
| f | bucket |
+---+--------+
| a |   0    |
+---+--------+
| b |   1    |
+---+--------+
| c |   1    |
+---+--------+
| d |   2    |
+------------+
```
