# The ML.POLYNOMIAL\_EXPAND function

This document describes the `  ML.POLYNOMIAL_EXPAND  ` function, which lets you calculate all polynomial combinations of the input features.

You can use this function with models that support [manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) . For more information, see the following documents:

  - [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey)
  - [Contribution analysis user journey](/bigquery/docs/contribution-analysis#contribution_analysis_user_journey)

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.POLYNOMIAL_EXPAND(struct_numerical_features [, degree])
```

### Arguments

`  ML.POLYNOMIAL_EXPAND  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  struct_numerical_features  ` : a `  STRUCT  ` value that contains the [numerical](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#numeric_types) input features to expand. You can specify less than or equal to `  10  ` input features. Don't specify unnamed features or duplicate features.
  - `  degree  ` : an `  INT64  ` value that specifies the highest degree of all combinations in the range of `  [1, 4]  ` . The default value is `  2  ` .

## Output

`  ML.POLYNOMIAL_EXPAND  ` returns a `  STRUCT<STRING>  ` value that contain all polynomial combinations of the numerical input features with a degree no larger than the passed-in degree, including the original features. The field names of the output struct are concatenations of the original feature names.

## Example

The following example calculates the polynomial expansion of two numerical features:

``` text
SELECT
  ML.POLYNOMIAL_EXPAND(STRUCT(2 AS f1, 3 AS f2)) AS output;
```

The output looks similar to the following:

``` console
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                              output                               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| {"f1":"2.0","f1_f1":"4.0","f1_f2":"6.0","f2":"3.0","f2_f2":"9.0"} |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
