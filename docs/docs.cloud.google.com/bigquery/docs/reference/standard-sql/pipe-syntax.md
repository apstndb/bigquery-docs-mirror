Pipe query syntax is an extension to GoogleSQL that's simpler and more concise than [standard query syntax](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) . Pipe syntax supports the same operations as standard syntax, and improves some areas of SQL query functionality and usability.

For more background and details on pipe syntax design, see the research paper [SQL Has Problems. We Can Fix Them: Pipe Syntax In SQL](https://research.google/pubs/sql-has-problems-we-can-fix-them-pipe-syntax-in-sql/) . For an introduction to pipe syntax, see [Work with pipe syntax](/bigquery/docs/pipe-syntax-guide) . To see examples of more complex queries written in pipe syntax, see [Analyze data using pipe syntax](/bigquery/docs/analyze-data-pipe-syntax) .

## Pipe syntax

Pipe syntax has the following key characteristics:

  - Each pipe operator in pipe syntax consists of the pipe symbol, `  |>  ` , an operator name, and any arguments:  
    `  |> operator_name argument_list  `
  - Pipe operators can be added to the end of any valid query.
  - Pipe syntax works anywhere standard syntax is supported: in queries, views, table-valued functions (TVFs), and other contexts.
  - Pipe syntax can be mixed with standard syntax in the same query. For example, subqueries can use different syntax from the parent query.
  - A pipe operator can see every alias that exists in the table preceding the pipe.
  - A query can [start with a `  FROM  ` clause](#from_queries) , and pipe operators can optionally be added after the `  FROM  ` clause.

### Query comparison

Consider the following table called `  Produce  ` :

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE Produce AS (
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales, 'fruit' AS category
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'carrots' AS item, 8 AS sales, 'vegetable' AS category
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 7 AS sales, 'fruit' AS category
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales, 'fruit' AS category
);

SELECT * FROM Produce;

/*---------+-------+-----------+
 | item    | sales | category  |
 +---------+-------+-----------+
 | apples  | 2     | fruit     |
 | carrots | 8     | vegetable |
 | apples  | 7     | fruit     |
 | bananas | 5     | fruit     |
 +---------+-------+-----------*/
```

Compare the following equivalent queries that compute the number and total amount of sales for each item in the `  Produce  ` table:

**Standard syntax**

``` text
SELECT item, COUNT(*) AS num_items, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM Produce
WHERE
  item != 'bananas'
  AND category IN ('fruit', 'nut')
GROUP BY item
ORDER BY item DESC;

/*--------+-----------+-------------+
 | item   | num_items | total_sales |
 +--------+-----------+-------------+
 | apples | 2         | 9           |
 +--------+-----------+-------------*/
```

**Pipe syntax**

``` text
FROM Produce
|> WHERE
    item != 'bananas'
    AND category IN ('fruit', 'nut')
|> AGGREGATE COUNT(*) AS num_items, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
   GROUP BY item
|> ORDER BY item DESC;

/*--------+-----------+-------------+
 | item   | num_items | total_sales |
 +--------+-----------+-------------+
 | apples | 2         | 9           |
 +--------+-----------+-------------*/
```

## Pipe operator semantics

Pipe operators have the following semantic behavior:

  - Each pipe operator performs a self-contained operation.
  - A pipe operator consumes the input table passed to it through the pipe symbol, `  |>  ` , and produces a new table as output.
  - A pipe operator can reference only columns from its immediate input table. Columns from earlier in the same query aren't visible. Inside subqueries, correlated references to outer columns are still allowed.

## `     FROM    ` queries

In pipe syntax, a query can start with a standard [`  FROM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#from_clause) and use any standard `  FROM  ` syntax, including tables, joins, subqueries, and table-valued functions (TVFs). Table aliases can be assigned to each input item using the [`  AS alias  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#using_aliases) .

A query with only a `  FROM  ` clause, like `  FROM table_name  ` , is allowed in pipe syntax and returns all rows from the table. For tables with columns, `  FROM table_name  ` in pipe syntax is similar to [`  SELECT * FROM table_name  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#select_) in standard syntax.

**Examples**

The following queries use the [`  Produce  ` table](#query_comparison) :

``` text
FROM Produce;

/*---------+-------+-----------+
 | item    | sales | category  |
 +---------+-------+-----------+
 | apples  | 2     | fruit     |
 | carrots | 8     | vegetable |
 | apples  | 7     | fruit     |
 | bananas | 5     | fruit     |
 +---------+-------+-----------*/
```

``` text
-- Join tables in the FROM clause and then apply pipe operators.
FROM
  Produce AS p1
  JOIN Produce AS p2
    USING (item)
|> WHERE item = 'bananas'
|> SELECT p1.item, p2.sales;

/*---------+-------+
 | item    | sales |
 +---------+-------+
 | bananas | 5     |
 +---------+-------*/
```

## Pipe operators

GoogleSQL supports the following pipe operators. For operators that correspond or relate to similar operations in standard syntax, the operator descriptions highlight similarities and differences and link to more detailed documentation on the corresponding syntax.

### `     SELECT    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> SELECT expression [[AS] alias] [, ...]
   [WINDOW name AS window_spec, ...]
```

**Description**

Produces a new table with the listed columns, similar to the outermost [`  SELECT  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#select_list) in a table subquery in standard syntax. The `  SELECT  ` operator supports standard output modifiers like `  SELECT AS STRUCT  ` and `  SELECT DISTINCT  ` . The `  SELECT  ` operator also supports [window functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls) , including [named windows](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls#def_use_named_window) . Named windows are defined using the `  WINDOW  ` keyword and are only visible to the current pipe `  SELECT  ` operator. The `  SELECT  ` operator doesn't support aggregations or anonymization.

In pipe syntax, the `  SELECT  ` operator in a query is optional. The `  SELECT  ` operator can be used near the end of a query to specify the list of output columns. The final query result contains the columns returned from the last pipe operator. If the `  SELECT  ` operator isn't used to select specific columns, the output includes the full row, similar to what the [`  SELECT *  ` statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#select_) in standard syntax produces.

In pipe syntax, the `  SELECT  ` clause doesn't perform aggregation. Use the [`  AGGREGATE  ` operator](#aggregate_pipe_operator) instead.

For cases where `  SELECT  ` would be used in standard syntax to rearrange columns, pipe syntax supports other operators:

  - The [`  EXTEND  ` operator](#extend_pipe_operator) adds columns.
  - The [`  SET  ` operator](#set_pipe_operator) updates the value of an existing column.
  - The [`  DROP  ` operator](#drop_pipe_operator) removes columns.
  - The [`  RENAME  ` operator](#rename_pipe_operator) renames columns.

**Examples**

``` text
FROM (SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales)
|> SELECT item AS fruit_name;

/*------------+
 | fruit_name |
 +------------+
 | apples     |
 +------------*/
```

``` text
-- Window function with a named window
FROM Produce
|> SELECT item, sales, category, SUM(sales) OVER item_window AS category_total
   WINDOW item_window AS (PARTITION BY category);

/*---------+-------+-----------+----------------+
 | item    | sales | category  | category_total |
 +---------+-------+-----------+----------------+
 | apples  | 2     | fruit     | 14             |
 | apples  | 7     | fruit     | 14             |
 | bananas | 5     | fruit     | 14             |
 | carrots | 8     | vegetable | 8              |
 +---------+-------+-----------+----------------*/
```

### `     EXTEND    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> EXTEND expression [[AS] alias] [, ...]
   [WINDOW name AS window_spec, ...]
```

**Description**

Propagates the existing table and adds computed columns, similar to [`  SELECT *, new_column  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#select_) in standard syntax. The `  EXTEND  ` operator supports [window functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls) , including [named windows](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls#def_use_named_window) . Named windows are defined using the `  WINDOW  ` keyword and are only visible to the current `  EXTEND  ` operator.

**Examples**

``` text
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 8 AS sales
)
|> EXTEND item IN ('bananas', 'lemons') AS is_yellow;

/*---------+-------+------------+
 | item    | sales | is_yellow  |
 +---------+-------+------------+
 | apples  | 2     | FALSE      |
 | bananas | 8     | TRUE       |
 +---------+-------+------------*/
```

``` text
-- Window function, with `OVER`
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'carrots' AS item, 8 AS sales
)
|> EXTEND SUM(sales) OVER() AS total_sales;

/*---------+-------+-------------+
 | item    | sales | total_sales |
 +---------+-------+-------------+
 | apples  | 2     | 15          |
 | bananas | 5     | 15          |
 | carrots | 8     | 15          |
 +---------+-------+-------------*/
```

``` text
-- Window function with a named window
FROM Produce
|> EXTEND SUM(sales) OVER item_window AS category_total
   WINDOW item_window AS (PARTITION BY category);

/*-----------+-----------+----------------+
 | item      | category  | category_total |
 +----------------------------------------+
 | apples    | fruit     | 14             |
 | apples    | fruit     | 14             |
 | bananas   | fruit     | 14             |
 | carrots   | vegetable | 8              |
 +----------------------------------------*/
```

### `     SET    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> SET column_name = expression [, ...]
```

**Description**

Replaces the value of a column in the input table, similar to [`  SELECT * REPLACE (expression AS column)  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#select_replace) in standard syntax. Each referenced column must exist exactly once in the input table.

After a `  SET  ` operation, the referenced top-level columns (like `  x  ` ) are updated, but table aliases (like `  t  ` ) still refer to the original row values. Therefore, `  t.x  ` will still refer to the original value.

**Example**

``` text
(
  SELECT 1 AS x, 11 AS y
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x, 22 AS y
)
|> SET x = x * x, y = 3;

/*---+---+
 | x | y |
 +---+---+
 | 1 | 3 |
 | 4 | 3 |
 +---+---*/
```

``` text
FROM (SELECT 2 AS x, 3 AS y) AS t
|> SET x = x * x, y = 8
|> SELECT t.x AS original_x, x, y;

/*------------+---+---+
 | original_x | x | y |
 +------------+---+---+
 | 2          | 4 | 8 |
 +------------+---+---*/
```

### `     DROP    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> DROP column_name [, ...]
```

**Description**

Removes listed columns from the input table, similar to [`  SELECT * EXCEPT (column)  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#select_except) in standard syntax. Each referenced column must exist at least once in the input table.

After a `  DROP  ` operation, the referenced top-level columns (like `  x  ` ) are removed, but table aliases (like `  t  ` ) still refer to the original row values. Therefore, `  t.x  ` will still refer to the original value.

**Example**

``` text
SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales, 'fruit' AS category
|> DROP sales, category;

/*--------+
 | item   |
 +--------+
 | apples |
 +--------*/
```

``` text
FROM (SELECT 1 AS x, 2 AS y) AS t
|> DROP x
|> SELECT t.x AS original_x, y;

/*------------+---+
 | original_x | y |
 +------------+---+
 | 1          | 2 |
 +------------+---*/
```

### `     RENAME    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> RENAME old_column_name [AS] new_column_name [, ...]
```

**Description**

Renames specified columns. Each column to be renamed must exist exactly once in the input table. The `  RENAME  ` operator can't rename value table fields, pseudo-columns, range variables, or objects that aren't columns in the input table.

After a `  RENAME  ` operation, the referenced top-level columns (like `  x  ` ) are renamed, but table aliases (like `  t  ` ) still refer to the original row values. Therefore, `  t.x  ` will still refer to the original value.

**Example**

``` text
SELECT 1 AS x, 2 AS y, 3 AS z
|> AS t
|> RENAME y AS renamed_y
|> SELECT *, t.y AS t_y;

/*---+-----------+---+-----+
 | x | renamed_y | z | t_y |
 +---+-----------+---+-----+
 | 1 | 2         | 3 | 2   |
 +---+-----------+---+-----*/
```

### `     AS    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> AS alias
```

**Description**

Introduces a table alias for the input table, similar to applying the [`  AS alias  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#using_aliases) on a table subquery in standard syntax. Any existing table aliases are removed and the new alias becomes the table alias for all columns in the row.

The `  AS  ` operator can be useful after operators like [`  SELECT  `](#select_pipe_operator) , [`  EXTEND  `](#extend_pipe_operator) , or [`  AGGREGATE  `](#aggregate_pipe_operator) that add columns but can't give table aliases to them. You can use the table alias to disambiguate columns after the `  JOIN  ` operator.

**Example**

``` text
(
  SELECT "000123" AS id, "apples" AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "000456" AS id, "bananas" AS item, 5 AS sales
) AS sales_table
|> AGGREGATE SUM(sales) AS total_sales GROUP BY id, item
-- AGGREGATE creates an output table, so the sales_table alias is now out of
-- scope. Add a t1 alias so the join can refer to its id column.
|> AS t1
|> JOIN (SELECT 456 AS id, "yellow" AS color) AS t2
   ON CAST(t1.id AS INT64) = t2.id
|> SELECT t2.id, total_sales, color;

/*-----+-------------+--------+
 | id  | total_sales | color  |
 +-----+-------------+--------+
 | 456 | 5           | yellow |
 +-----+-------------+--------*/
```

### `     WHERE    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> WHERE boolean_expression
```

**Description**

Filters the results of the input table. The `  WHERE  ` operator behaves the same as the [`  WHERE  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#where_clause) in standard syntax.

In pipe syntax, the `  WHERE  ` operator also replaces the [`  HAVING  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#having_clause) and [`  QUALIFY  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#qualify_clause) in standard syntax. For example, after performing aggregation with the [`  AGGREGATE  ` operator](#aggregate_pipe_operator) , use the `  WHERE  ` operator instead of the `  HAVING  ` clause. For [window functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls) inside a `  QUALIFY  ` clause, use window functions inside a `  WHERE  ` clause instead.

**Example**

``` text
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'carrots' AS item, 8 AS sales
)
|> WHERE sales >= 3;

/*---------+-------+
 | item    | sales |
 +---------+-------+
 | bananas | 5     |
 | carrots | 8     |
 +---------+-------*/
```

### `     AGGREGATE    ` pipe operator

``` text
-- Full-table aggregation
|> AGGREGATE aggregate_expression [[AS] alias] [, ...]
```

``` text
-- Aggregation with grouping
|> AGGREGATE [aggregate_expression [[AS] alias] [, ...]]
   GROUP BY groupable_items [[AS] alias] [, ...]
```

``` text
-- Aggregation with grouping and shorthand ordering syntax
|> AGGREGATE [aggregate_expression [[AS] alias] [order_suffix] [, ...]]
   GROUP [AND ORDER] BY groupable_item [[AS] alias] [order_suffix] [, ...]

order_suffix: {ASC | DESC} [{NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST}]
```

**Description**

Performs aggregation on data across grouped rows or an entire table. The `  AGGREGATE  ` operator is similar to a query in standard syntax that contains a [`  GROUP BY  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#group_by_clause) or a `  SELECT  ` list with [aggregate functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions) or both. In pipe syntax, the `  GROUP BY  ` clause is part of the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator. Pipe syntax doesn't support a standalone `  GROUP BY  ` operator.

Without the `  GROUP BY  ` clause, the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator performs full-table aggregation and produces one output row.

With the `  GROUP BY  ` clause, the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator performs aggregation with grouping, producing one row for each set of distinct values for the grouping expressions.

The `  AGGREGATE  ` expression list corresponds to the aggregated expressions in a `  SELECT  ` list in standard syntax. Each expression in the `  AGGREGATE  ` list must include an aggregate function. Aggregate expressions can also include scalar expressions (for example, `  sqrt(SUM(x*x))  ` ). Column aliases can be assigned using the [`  AS  ` operator](#as_pipe_operator) . Window functions aren't allowed, but the [`  EXTEND  ` operator](#extend_pipe_operator) can be used before the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator to compute window functions.

The `  GROUP BY  ` clause in the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator corresponds to the `  GROUP BY  ` clause in standard syntax. Unlike in standard syntax, aliases can be assigned to `  GROUP BY  ` items. Standard grouping operators like `  GROUPING SETS  ` , `  ROLLUP  ` , and `  CUBE  ` are supported.

The output columns from the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator include all grouping columns first, followed by all aggregate columns, using their assigned aliases as the column names.

Unlike in standard syntax, grouping expressions aren't repeated across `  SELECT  ` and `  GROUP BY  ` clauses. In pipe syntax, the grouping expressions are listed once, in the `  GROUP BY  ` clause, and are automatically included as output columns for the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator.

Because output columns are fully specified by the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator, the `  SELECT  ` operator isn't needed after the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator unless you want to produce a list of columns different from the default.

**Standard syntax**

``` text
-- Aggregation in standard syntax
SELECT SUM(col1) AS total, col2, col3, col4...
FROM table1
GROUP BY col2, col3, col4...
```

**Pipe syntax**

``` text
-- The same aggregation in pipe syntax
FROM table1
|> AGGREGATE SUM(col1) AS total
   GROUP BY col2, col3, col4...
```

**Examples**

``` text
-- Full-table aggregation
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 7 AS sales
)
|> AGGREGATE COUNT(*) AS num_items, SUM(sales) AS total_sales;

/*-----------+-------------+
 | num_items | total_sales |
 +-----------+-------------+
 | 3         | 14          |
 +-----------+-------------*/
```

``` text
-- Aggregation with grouping
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 7 AS sales
)
|> AGGREGATE COUNT(*) AS num_items, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
   GROUP BY item;

/*---------+-----------+-------------+
 | item    | num_items | total_sales |
 +---------+-----------+-------------+
 | apples  | 2         | 9           |
 | bananas | 1         | 5           |
 +---------+-----------+-------------*/
```

#### Shorthand ordering syntax with `     AGGREGATE    `

The `  AGGREGATE  ` operator supports a shorthand ordering syntax, which is equivalent to applying the [`  ORDER BY  ` operator](#order_by_pipe_operator) as part of the `  AGGREGATE  ` operator without repeating the column list:

``` text
-- Aggregation with grouping and shorthand ordering syntax
|> AGGREGATE [aggregate_expression [[AS] alias] [order_suffix] [, ...]]
   GROUP [AND ORDER] BY groupable_item [[AS] alias] [order_suffix] [, ...]

order_suffix: {ASC | DESC} [{NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST}]
```

The `  GROUP AND ORDER BY  ` clause is equivalent to an `  ORDER BY  ` clause on all `  groupable_items  ` . By default, each `  groupable_item  ` is sorted in ascending order with `  NULL  ` values first. Other ordering suffixes like `  DESC  ` or `  NULLS LAST  ` can be used for other orders.

Without the `  GROUP AND ORDER BY  ` clause, the `  ASC  ` or `  DESC  ` suffixes can be added on individual columns in the `  GROUP BY  ` list or `  AGGREGATE  ` list or both. The `  NULLS FIRST  ` and `  NULLS LAST  ` suffixes can be used to further modify `  NULL  ` sorting.

Adding these suffixes is equivalent to adding an `  ORDER BY  ` clause that includes all of the suffixed columns with the suffixed grouping columns first, matching the left-to-right output column order.

**Examples**

Consider the following table called `  Produce  ` :

``` text
/*---------+-------+-----------+
 | item    | sales | category  |
 +---------+-------+-----------+
 | apples  | 2     | fruit     |
 | carrots | 8     | vegetable |
 | apples  | 7     | fruit     |
 | bananas | 5     | fruit     |
 +---------+-------+-----------*/
```

The following two equivalent examples show you how to order by all grouping columns using the `  GROUP AND ORDER BY  ` clause or a separate `  ORDER BY  ` clause:

``` text
-- Order by all grouping columns using GROUP AND ORDER BY.
FROM Produce
|> AGGREGATE SUM(sales) AS total_sales
   GROUP AND ORDER BY category, item DESC;

/*-----------+---------+-------------+
 | category  | item    | total_sales |
 +-----------+---------+-------------+
 | fruit     | bananas | 5           |
 | fruit     | apples  | 9           |
 | vegetable | carrots | 8           |
 +-----------+---------+-------------*/
```

``` text
--Order by columns using ORDER BY after performing aggregation.
FROM Produce
|> AGGREGATE SUM(sales) AS total_sales
   GROUP BY category, item
|> ORDER BY category, item DESC;
```

You can add an ordering suffix to a column in the `  AGGREGATE  ` list. Although the `  AGGREGATE  ` list appears before the `  GROUP BY  ` list in the query, ordering suffixes on columns in the `  GROUP BY  ` list are applied first.

``` text
FROM Produce
|> AGGREGATE SUM(sales) AS total_sales ASC
   GROUP BY item, category DESC;

/*---------+-----------+-------------+
 | item    | category  | total_sales |
 +---------+-----------+-------------+
 | carrots | vegetable | 8           |
 | bananas | fruit     | 5           |
 | apples  | fruit     | 9           |
 +---------+-----------+-------------*/
```

The previous query is equivalent to the following:

``` text
-- Order by specified grouping and aggregate columns.
FROM Produce
|> AGGREGATE SUM(sales) AS total_sales
   GROUP BY item, category
|> ORDER BY category DESC, total_sales;
```

### `     DISTINCT    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> DISTINCT
```

**Description**

Returns distinct rows from the input table, while preserving table aliases.

Using the `  DISTINCT  ` operator after a `  SELECT  ` or `  UNION ALL  ` clause is similar to using a [`  SELECT DISTINCT  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#select_distinct) or [`  UNION DISTINCT  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#union) in standard syntax, but the `  DISTINCT  ` pipe operator can be applied anywhere. The `  DISTINCT  ` operator computes distinct rows based on the values of all visible columns. Pseudo-columns are ignored while computing distinct rows and are dropped from the output.

The `  DISTINCT  ` operator is similar to using a `  |> SELECT DISTINCT *  ` clause, but doesn't expand value table fields, and preserves table aliases from the input.

**Examples**

``` text
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'carrots' AS item, 8 AS sales
)
|> DISTINCT
|> WHERE sales >= 3;

/*---------+-------+
 | item    | sales |
 +---------+-------+
 | bananas | 5     |
 | carrots | 8     |
 +---------+-------*/
```

In the following example, the table alias `  Produce  ` can be used in expressions after the `  DISTINCT  ` pipe operator.

``` text
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'carrots' AS item, 8 AS sales
)
|> AS Produce
|> DISTINCT
|> SELECT Produce.item;

/*---------+
 | item    |
 +---------+
 | apples  |
 | bananas |
 | carrots |
 +---------*/
```

By contrast, the table alias isn't visible after a `  |> SELECT DISTINCT *  ` clause.

``` text
-- Error, unrecognized name: Produce
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'carrots' AS item, 8 AS sales
)
|> AS Produce
|> SELECT DISTINCT *
|> SELECT Produce.item;
```

In the following examples, the `  DISTINCT  ` operator doesn't expand value table fields and retains the `  STRUCT  ` type in the result. By contrast, the `  |> SELECT DISTINCT *  ` clause expands the `  STRUCT  ` type into two columns.

``` text
SELECT AS STRUCT 1 x, 2 y
|> DISTINCT;

/*---------+
 | $struct |
 +---------+
  {
    x: 1,
    y: 2
  }
 +----------*/
```

``` text
SELECT AS STRUCT 1 x, 2 y
|> SELECT DISTINCT *;

/*---+---+
 | x | y |
 +---+---+
 | 1 | 2 |
 +---+---*/
```

The following examples show equivalent ways to generate the same results with distinct values from columns `  a  ` , `  b  ` , and `  c  ` .

``` text
FROM table
|> SELECT DISTINCT a, b, c;

FROM table
|> SELECT a, b, c
|> DISTINCT;

FROM table
|> AGGREGATE
   GROUP BY a, b, c;
```

### `     JOIN    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> [join_type] JOIN from_item [[AS] alias] [{on_clause | using_clause}]
```

**Description**

Joins rows from the input table with rows from a second table provided as an argument. The `  JOIN  ` operator behaves the same as the [`  JOIN  ` operation](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#join_types) in standard syntax. The input table is the left side of the join and the `  JOIN  ` argument is the right side of the join. Standard join inputs are supported, including tables, subqueries, `  UNNEST  ` operations, and table-valued function (TVF) calls. Standard join modifiers like `  LEFT  ` , `  INNER  ` , and `  CROSS  ` are allowed before the `  JOIN  ` keyword.

An alias can be assigned to the input table on the right side of the join, but not to the input table on the left side of the join. If an alias on the input table is needed, perhaps to disambiguate columns in an [`  ON  ` expression](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#on_clause) , then an alias can be added using the [`  AS  ` operator](#as_pipe_operator) before the `  JOIN  ` arguments.

**Example**

``` text
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
)
|> AS produce_sales
|> LEFT JOIN
     (
       SELECT "apples" AS item, 123 AS id
     ) AS produce_data
   ON produce_sales.item = produce_data.item
|> SELECT produce_sales.item, sales, id;

/*---------+-------+------+
 | item    | sales | id   |
 +---------+-------+------+
 | apples  | 2     | 123  |
 | bananas | 5     | NULL |
 +---------+-------+------*/
```

### `     CALL    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> CALL table_function (argument [, ...]) [[AS] alias]
```

**Description**

Calls a [table-valued function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/table-functions#tvfs) (TVF) that accepts at least one table as an argument, similar to [table function calls](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#table_function_calls) in standard syntax.

TVFs in standard syntax can be called in the `  FROM  ` clause or in a `  JOIN  ` operation. These are both allowed in pipe syntax as well.

In pipe syntax, TVFs that take a table argument can also be called with the `  CALL  ` operator. The first table argument comes from the input table and must be omitted in the arguments. An optional table alias can be added for the output table.

Multiple TVFs can be called sequentially without using nested subqueries.

**Examples**

Suppose you have TVFs with the following parameters:

  - `  tvf1(inputTable1, arg1 ANY TYPE)  ` and
  - `  tvf2(arg2 ANY TYPE, arg3 ANY TYPE, inputTable2)  ` .

The following examples compare calling both TVFs on an input table by using standard syntax and by using the `  CALL  ` pipe operator:

``` text
-- Call the TVFs without using the CALL operator.
SELECT *
FROM
  tvf2(arg2, arg3, TABLE tvf1(TABLE input_table, arg1));
```

``` text
-- Call the same TVFs with the CALL operator.
FROM input_table
|> CALL tvf1(arg1)
|> CALL tvf2(arg2, arg3);
```

### `     ORDER BY    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> ORDER BY expression [sort_options] [, ...]
```

**Description**

Sorts results by a list of expressions. The `  ORDER BY  ` operator behaves the same as the [`  ORDER BY  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#order_by_clause) in standard syntax. Suffixes like `  ASC  ` , `  DESC  ` , and `  NULLS LAST  ` are supported for customizing the ordering for each expression.

In pipe syntax, the [`  AGGREGATE  ` operator](#aggregate_pipe_operator) also supports [shorthand ordering suffixes](#shorthand_order_pipe_syntax) to apply `  ORDER BY  ` behavior more concisely as part of aggregation.

**Example**

``` text
(
  SELECT 1 AS x
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3 AS x
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2 AS x
)
|> ORDER BY x DESC;

/*---+
 | x |
 +---+
 | 3 |
 | 2 |
 | 1 |
 +---*/
```

### `     LIMIT    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> LIMIT count [OFFSET skip_rows]
```

**Description**

Limits the number of rows to return in a query, with an optional `  OFFSET  ` clause to skip over rows. The `  LIMIT  ` operator behaves the same as the [`  LIMIT  ` and `  OFFSET  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#limit_and_offset_clause) in standard syntax.

**Examples**

``` text
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'carrots' AS item, 8 AS sales
)
|> ORDER BY item
|> LIMIT 1;

/*---------+-------+
 | item    | sales |
 +---------+-------+
 | apples  | 2     |
 +---------+-------*/
```

``` text
(
  SELECT 'apples' AS item, 2 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'bananas' AS item, 5 AS sales
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'carrots' AS item, 8 AS sales
)
|> ORDER BY item
|> LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;

/*---------+-------+
 | item    | sales |
 +---------+-------+
 | carrots | 8     |
 +---------+-------*/
```

### `     UNION    ` pipe operator

``` text
query
|> UNION {ALL | DISTINCT} (query) [, (query), ...]
```

**Description**

Returns the combined results of the input queries to the left and right of the pipe operator. Columns are matched and rows are concatenated vertically.

The `  UNION  ` pipe operator behaves the same as the [`  UNION  ` set operator](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#union) in standard syntax. However, in pipe syntax, the `  UNION  ` pipe operator can include multiple comma-separated queries without repeating the `  UNION  ` syntax. Queries following the operator are enclosed in parentheses.

For example, compare the following equivalent queries:

``` text
-- Standard syntax
SELECT * FROM ...
UNION ALL
SELECT 1
UNION ALL
SELECT 2;

-- Pipe syntax
SELECT * FROM ...
|> UNION ALL
    (SELECT 1),
    (SELECT 2);
```

The `  UNION  ` pipe operator supports the same modifiers as the `  UNION  ` set operator in standard syntax, such as the `  BY NAME  ` modifier (or `  CORRESPONDING  ` ) and `  LEFT | FULL [OUTER]  ` mode prefixes.

**Examples**

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3]) AS number
|> UNION ALL (SELECT 1);

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 1      |
 | 2      |
 | 3      |
 | 1      |
 +--------*/
```

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3]) AS number
|> UNION DISTINCT (SELECT 1);

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 1      |
 | 2      |
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example shows multiple input queries to the right of the pipe operator:

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3]) AS number
|> UNION DISTINCT
    (SELECT 1),
    (SELECT 2);

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 1      |
 | 2      |
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example uses the `  BY NAME  ` modifier to match results by column name instead of in the order that the columns are given in the input queries.

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
|> UNION ALL BY NAME
    (SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit);

/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 | 2         | 20        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

Without the `  BY NAME  ` modifier, the results are matched by column position in the input query and the column names are ignored.

``` text
SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
|> UNION ALL
    (SELECT 20 AS two_digit, 2 AS one_digit);

-- Results follow column order from queries and ignore column names.
/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 | 20        | 2         |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

### `     INTERSECT    ` pipe operator

``` text
query
|> INTERSECT DISTINCT (query) [, (query), ...]
```

**Description**

Returns rows that are found in the results of both the input query to the left of the pipe operator and all input queries to the right of the pipe operator.

The `  INTERSECT  ` pipe operator behaves the same as the [`  INTERSECT  ` set operator](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#intersect) in standard syntax. However, in pipe syntax, the `  INTERSECT  ` pipe operator can include multiple comma-separated queries without repeating the `  INTERSECT  ` syntax. Queries following the operator are enclosed in parentheses.

For example, compare the following equivalent queries:

``` text
-- Standard syntax
SELECT * FROM ...
INTERSECT DISTINCT
SELECT 1
INTERSECT DISTINCT
SELECT 2;

-- Pipe syntax
SELECT * FROM ...
|> INTERSECT DISTINCT
    (SELECT 1),
    (SELECT 2);
```

The `  INTERSECT  ` pipe operator supports the same modifiers as the `  INTERSECT  ` set operator in standard syntax, such as the `  BY NAME  ` modifier (or `  CORRESPONDING  ` ) and `  LEFT | FULL [OUTER]  ` mode prefixes.

**Examples**

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
|> INTERSECT DISTINCT
    (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[2, 3, 3, 5]) AS number);

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 2      |
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example shows multiple input queries to the right of the pipe operator:

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
|> INTERSECT DISTINCT
    (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[2, 3, 3, 5]) AS number),
    (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[3, 3, 4, 5]) AS number);

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example uses the `  BY NAME  ` modifier to return the intersecting row from the columns despite the differing column order in the input queries.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
|> INTERSECT DISTINCT BY NAME
    (SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit);

/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

Without the `  BY NAME  ` modifier, the same columns in differing order are considered different columns, so the query doesn't detect any intersecting row values.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
|> INTERSECT DISTINCT
    (SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit);

-- No intersecting values detected because columns aren't recognized as the same.
/*-----------+-----------+

 +-----------+-----------*/
```

### `     EXCEPT    ` pipe operator

``` text
query
|> EXCEPT DISTINCT (query) [, (query), ...]
```

**Description**

Returns rows from the input query to the left of the pipe operator that aren't present in any input queries to the right of the pipe operator.

The `  EXCEPT  ` pipe operator behaves the same as the [`  EXCEPT  ` set operator](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#except) in standard syntax. However, in pipe syntax, the `  EXCEPT  ` pipe operator can include multiple comma-separated queries without repeating the `  EXCEPT  ` syntax. Queries following the operator are enclosed in parentheses.

For example, compare the following equivalent queries:

``` text
-- Standard syntax
SELECT * FROM ...
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT 1
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT 2;

-- Pipe syntax
SELECT * FROM ...
|> EXCEPT DISTINCT
    (SELECT 1),
    (SELECT 2);
```

Parentheses can be used to group set operations and control order of operations. In `  EXCEPT  ` set operations, query results can vary depending on the operation grouping.

``` text
-- Default operation grouping
(
  SELECT * FROM ...
  EXCEPT DISTINCT
  SELECT 1
)
EXCEPT DISTINCT
SELECT 2;

-- Modified operation grouping
SELECT * FROM ...
EXCEPT DISTINCT
(
  SELECT 1
  EXCEPT DISTINCT
  SELECT 2
);

-- Same modified operation grouping in pipe syntax
SELECT * FROM ...
|> EXCEPT DISTINCT
(
  SELECT 1
  |> EXCEPT DISTINCT (SELECT 2)
);
```

The `  EXCEPT  ` pipe operator supports the same modifiers as the `  EXCEPT  ` set operator in standard syntax, such as the `  BY NAME  ` modifier (or `  CORRESPONDING  ` ) and `  LEFT | FULL [OUTER]  ` mode prefixes.

**Examples**

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
|> EXCEPT DISTINCT
    (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2]) AS number);

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 3      |
 | 4      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example shows multiple input queries to the right of the pipe operator:

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
|> EXCEPT DISTINCT
    (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2]) AS number),
    (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 4]) AS number);

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 3      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example groups the set operations to modify the order of operations. The first input query is used against the result of the last two queries instead of the values of the last two queries individually.

``` text
SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2, 3, 3, 4]) AS number
|> EXCEPT DISTINCT
(
  SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 2]) AS number
  |> EXCEPT DISTINCT
      (SELECT * FROM UNNEST(ARRAY<INT64>[1, 4]) AS number)
);

/*--------+
 | number |
 +--------+
 | 1      |
 | 3      |
 | 4      |
 +--------*/
```

The following example uses the `  BY NAME  ` modifier to return unique rows from the input query to the left of the pipe operator despite the differing column order in the input queries.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
|> EXCEPT DISTINCT BY NAME
    (SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit);

/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 2         | 20        |
 | 3         | 30        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

Without the `  BY NAME  ` modifier, the same columns in differing order are considered different columns, so the query doesn't detect any common rows that should be excluded.

``` text
WITH
  NumbersTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS one_digit, 10 AS two_digit
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2, 20
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3, 30
  )
SELECT one_digit, two_digit FROM NumbersTable
|> EXCEPT DISTINCT
    (SELECT 10 AS two_digit, 1 AS one_digit);

-- No values excluded because columns aren't recognized as the same.
/*-----------+-----------+
 | one_digit | two_digit |
 +-----------+-----------+
 | 1         | 10        |
 | 2         | 20        |
 | 3         | 30        |
 +-----------+-----------*/
```

``` text
|> TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (percent PERCENT)
```

**Description**

Selects a random sample of rows from the input table. The `  TABLESAMPLE  ` pipe operator behaves the same as [`  TABLESAMPLE  ` operator](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#tablesample_operator) in standard syntax.

**Example**

The following example samples approximately 1% of data from a table called `  LargeTable  ` :

``` text
FROM LargeTable
|> TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT);
```

### `     WITH    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> WITH alias AS query, ...
```

**Description**

Defines one or more common table expressions (CTEs) that the rest of the query can reference, similar to standard [`  WITH  ` clauses](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#with_clause) . Ignores the pipe input table and passes it through as the input to the next pipe operation.

**Examples**

``` text
SELECT 1 AS key
|> WITH t AS (
    SELECT 1 AS key, 'my_value' AS value
  )
|> INNER JOIN t USING (key)

/*---------+---------+
 | key     | value   |
 +---------+---------+
 | 1       | my_value|
 +---------+---------*/
```

``` text
SELECT 1 AS key
-- Define multiple CTEs.
|> WITH t1 AS (
    SELECT 2
  ), t2 AS (
    SELECT 3
  )
|> UNION ALL (FROM t1), (FROM t2)

/*-----+
 | key |
 +-----+
 | 1   |
 | 2   |
 | 3   |
 +-----*/
```

The pipe `  WITH  ` operator allows a trailing comma:

``` text
SELECT 1 AS key
|> WITH t1 AS (
     SELECT 2
   ), t2 AS (
     SELECT 3
   ),
|> UNION ALL (FROM t1), (FROM t2)

/*-----+
 | key |
 +-----+
 | 1   |
 | 2   |
 | 3   |
 +-----*/
```

### `     PIVOT    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> PIVOT (aggregate_expression FOR input_column IN (pivot_column [, ...])) [[AS] alias]
```

**Description**

Rotates rows into columns. The `  PIVOT  ` pipe operator behaves the same as the [`  PIVOT  ` operator](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#pivot_operator) in standard syntax.

**Example**

``` text
(
  SELECT "kale" AS product, 51 AS sales, "Q1" AS quarter
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "kale" AS product, 4 AS sales, "Q1" AS quarter
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "kale" AS product, 45 AS sales, "Q2" AS quarter
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "apple" AS product, 8 AS sales, "Q1" AS quarter
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "apple" AS product, 10 AS sales, "Q2" AS quarter
)
|> PIVOT(SUM(sales) FOR quarter IN ('Q1', 'Q2'));

/*---------+----+------+
 | product | Q1 | Q2   |
 +---------+-----------+
 | kale    | 55 | 45   |
 | apple   | 8  | 10   |
 +---------+----+------*/
```

### `     UNPIVOT    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> UNPIVOT (values_column FOR name_column IN (column_to_unpivot [, ...])) [[AS] alias]
```

**Description**

Rotates columns into rows. The `  UNPIVOT  ` pipe operator behaves the same as the [`  UNPIVOT  ` operator](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unpivot_operator) in standard syntax.

**Example**

``` text
(
  SELECT 'kale' as product, 55 AS Q1, 45 AS Q2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'apple', 8, 10
)
|> UNPIVOT(sales FOR quarter IN (Q1, Q2));

/*---------+-------+---------+
 | product | sales | quarter |
 +---------+-------+---------+
 | kale    | 55    | Q1      |
 | kale    | 45    | Q2      |
 | apple   | 8     | Q1      |
 | apple   | 10    | Q2      |
 +---------+-------+---------*/
```

### `     MATCH_RECOGNIZE    ` pipe operator

``` text
|> MATCH_RECOGNIZE (
   [ PARTITION BY partition_expr [, ... ] ]
   ORDER BY order_expr [ { ASC | DESC } ] [ { NULLS FIRST | NULLS LAST } ] [, ...]
   MEASURES { measures_expr [AS] alias } [, ... ]
   [ AFTER MATCH SKIP { PAST LAST ROW | TO NEXT ROW } ]
   PATTERN (pattern)
   DEFINE symbol AS boolean_expr [, ... ]
   [ OPTIONS ( [ use_longest_match = { TRUE | FALSE } ] ) ]
)
```

**Description**

Filters and aggregates rows based on matches. A *match* is an ordered sequence of rows that match a pattern that you specify. Matching rows works similarly to matching with regular expressions, but instead of matching characters in a string, the `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` operator finds matches across rows in a table. The `  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` pipe operator behaves the same as the [`  MATCH_RECOGNIZE  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#match_recognize_clause) in standard syntax.

**Example**

``` text
(
  SELECT 1 as x
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 3
)
|> MATCH_RECOGNIZE(
   ORDER BY x
   MEASURES
     ARRAY_AGG(high.x) AS high_agg,
     ARRAY_AGG(low.x) AS low_agg
   AFTER MATCH SKIP TO NEXT ROW
   PATTERN (low | high)
   DEFINE
     low AS x <= 2,
     high AS x >= 2
);

/*----------+---------+
 | high_agg | low_agg |
 +----------+---------+
 | NULL     | [1]     |
 | NULL     | [2]     |
 | [3]      | NULL    |
 +----------+---------*/
```
