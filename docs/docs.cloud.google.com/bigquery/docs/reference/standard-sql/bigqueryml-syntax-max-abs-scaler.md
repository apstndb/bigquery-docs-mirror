# The ML.MAX\_ABS\_SCALER function

This document describes the `  ML.MAX_ABS_SCALER  ` function, which lets you scale a numerical expression to the range `  [-1, 1]  ` by dividing with the maximum absolute value. It doesn't shift or center the data, and so doesn't destroy any sparsity.

When used in the [`  TRANSFORM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#transform) , the maximum absolute value calculated during training is automatically used in prediction.

You can use this function with models that support [manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) . For more information, see the following documents:

  - [End-to-end user journeys for ML models](/bigquery/docs/e2e-journey)
  - [Contribution analysis user journey](/bigquery/docs/contribution-analysis#contribution_analysis_user_journey)

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.MAX_ABS_SCALER(numerical_expression) OVER()
```

### Arguments

`  ML.MAX_ABS_SCALER  ` takes the following argument:

  - `  numerical_expression  ` : the [numerical](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#numeric_types) expression to scale.

## Output

`  ML.MAX_ABS_SCALER  ` returns a `  FLOAT64  ` value that represents the scaled numerical expression.

## Example

The following example scales a set of numerical expressions to have values between `  -1  ` and `  1  ` :

``` text
SELECT f, ML.MAX_ABS_SCALER(f) OVER () AS output
FROM
  UNNEST([NULL, -3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) AS f
ORDER BY f;
```

The output looks similar to the following:

``` console
+------+--------+
|  f   | output |
+------+--------+
| NULL |   NULL |
|   -3 |   -0.6 |
|    1 |    0.2 |
|    2 |    0.4 |
|    3 |    0.6 |
|    4 |    0.8 |
|    5 |    1.0 |
+------+--------+
```
