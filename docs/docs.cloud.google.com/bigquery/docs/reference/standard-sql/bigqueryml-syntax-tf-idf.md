# The ML.TF\_IDF function

The term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. Use the `  ML.TF_IDF  ` function to compute TF-IDF of terms in a document, given the precomputed inverse-document frequency for use in machine learning model creation.

This function uses a TF-IDF algorithm to compute the relevance of terms in a set of tokenized documents. TF-IDF multiplies two metrics: how many times a term appears in a document (term frequency), and the inverse document frequency of the term across a collection of documents (inverse document frequency).

  - TF-IDF:
    
    ``` text
    term frequency * inverse document frequency
    ```

  - Term frequency:
    
    ``` text
    (count of term in document) / (document size)
    ```

  - Inverse document frequency:
    
    ``` text
    log(1 + num_documents / (1 + token_document_count))
    ```

Terms are added to a dictionary of terms if they satisfy the criteria for `  top_k  ` and `  frequency_threshold  ` , otherwise they are considered the *unknown term* . The unknown term is always the first term in the dictionary and represented as `  0  ` . The rest of the dictionary is ordered alphabetically.

You can use this function with models that support [manual feature preprocessing](/bigquery/docs/manual-preprocessing) . For more information, see the following documents:

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.TF_IDF(
  tokenized_document
  [, top_k]
  [, frequency_threshold]
)
OVER()
```

### Arguments

`  ML.TF_IDF  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  tokenized_document  ` : `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` value that represents a document that has been tokenized. A tokenized document is a collection of terms (tokens), which are used for text analysis.
  - `  top_k  ` : Optional argument. Takes an `  INT64  ` value, which represents the size of the dictionary, excluding the unknown term. The `  top_k  ` terms that appear in the most documents are added to the dictionary until this threshold is met. For example, if this value is `  20  ` , the top 20 unique terms that appear in the most documents are added and then no additional terms are added.
  - `  frequency_threshold  ` : Optional argument. Take an `  INT64  ` value that represents the minimum number of documents a term must appear in to be included in the dictionary. For example, if this value is `  3  ` , a term must appear in at least three documents to be added to the dictionary.

## Output

`  ML.TF_IDF  ` returns the input table plus the following two columns:

`  ARRAY<STRUCT<index INT64, value FLOAT64>>  `

Definitions:

  - `  index  ` : The index of the term that was added to the dictionary. Unknown terms have an index of 0.

  - `  value  ` : The TF-IDF computation for the term.

## Quotas

See [Cloud AI service functions quotas and limits](/bigquery/quotas#cloud_ai_service_functions) .

## Example

The following example creates a table `  ExampleTable  ` and applies the `  ML.TF_IDF  ` function:

``` text
WITH
  ExampleTable AS (
    SELECT 1 AS id, ['I', 'like', 'pie', 'pie', 'pie', NULL] AS f
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 2 AS id, ['yum', 'yum', 'pie', NULL] AS f
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 3 AS id, ['I', 'yum', 'pie', NULL] AS f
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 4 AS id, ['you', 'like', 'pie', NULL] AS f
  )
SELECT id, ML.TF_IDF(f, 3, 1) OVER () AS results
FROM ExampleTable
ORDER BY id;
```

The output is similar to the following:

``` text
+----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| id |                                                                                     results                                                                                     |
