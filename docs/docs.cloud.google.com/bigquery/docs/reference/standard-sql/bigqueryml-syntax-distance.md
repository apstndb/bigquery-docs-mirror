# The ML.DISTANCE function

This document describes the `  ML.DISTANCE  ` scalar function, which lets you compute the distance between two vectors.

**Note:** The [`  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/search_functions#vector_search) is another vector function that calculates the distance between vectors. You should use the `  VECTOR_SEARCH  ` function if you need to search a dataset for vectors similar to an input vector. You should use the `  ML.DISTANCE  ` function if you need to compare two specific vectors to determine the distance between them.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.DISTANCE(vector1, vector2 [, type])
```

### Arguments

`  ML.DISTANCE  ` has the following arguments:

  - `  vector1  ` : an `  ARRAY  ` value that represents the first vector, in one of the following forms:
    
      - `  ARRAY<Numerical type>  `
      - `  ARRAY<STRUCT<STRING, Numerical type>>  `
      - `  ARRAY<STRUCT<INT64, Numerical type>>  `
    
    where `  Numerical type  ` is `  BIGNUMERIC  ` , `  FLOAT64  ` , `  INT64  ` or `  NUMERIC  ` . For example `  ARRAY<STRUCT<INT64, BIGNUMERIC>>  ` .
    
    When a vector is expressed as `  ARRAY<Numerical type>  ` , each element of the array denotes one dimension of the vector. An example of a four-dimensional vector is `  [0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]  ` .
    
    When a vector is expressed as `  ARRAY<STRUCT<STRING, Numerical type>>  ` or `  ARRAY<STRUCT<INT64, Numerical type>>  ` , each `  STRUCT  ` array item denotes one dimension of the vector. An example of a three-dimensional vector is `  [("a", 0.0), ("b", 1.0), ("c", 1.0)]  ` .
    
    The initial `  INT64  ` or `  STRING  ` value in the `  STRUCT  ` is used as an identifier to match the `  STRUCT  ` values in `  vector2  ` . The ordering of data in the array doesn't matter; the values are matched by the identifier rather than by their position in the array. If either vector has any `  STRUCT  ` values with duplicate identifiers, running this function returns an error.

  - `  vector2  ` : an `  ARRAY  ` value that represents the second vector.
    
    `  vector2  ` must have the same type as `  vector1  ` .
    
    For example, if `  vector1  ` is an `  ARRAY<STRUCT<STRING, FLOAT64>>  ` column with three elements, like `  [("a", 0.0), ("b", 1.0), ("c", 1.0)]  ` , then `  vector2  ` must also be an `  ARRAY<STRUCT<STRING, FLOAT64>>  ` column.
    
    When `  vector1  ` and `  vector2  ` are `  ARRAY<Numerical type>  ` columns, they must have the same array length.

  - `  type  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that specifies the type of distance to calculate. Valid values are [`  EUCLIDEAN  `](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/euclidndstnc.html) , [`  MANHATTAN  `](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html) , and [`  COSINE  `](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity#Cosine_Distance) . If this argument isn't specified, the default value is `  EUCLIDEAN  ` .

## Output

`  ML.DISTANCE  ` returns a `  FLOAT64  ` value that represents the distance between the vectors. Returns `  NULL  ` if either `  vector1  ` or `  vector2  ` is `  NULL  ` .

## Example

Get the Euclidean distance for two tensors of `  ARRAY<FLOAT64>  ` values:

1.  Create the table `  t1  ` :
    
    ``` text
    CREATE TABLE mydataset.t1
    (
    v1 ARRAY<FLOAT64>,
    v2 ARRAY<FLOAT64>
    )
    ```

2.  Populate `  t1  ` :
    
    ``` text
    INSERT mydataset.t1 (v1,v2)
    VALUES ([4.1,0.5,1.0], [3.0,0.0,2.5])
    ```

3.  Calculate the Euclidean norm for `  v1  ` and `  v2  ` :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT v1, v2, ML.DISTANCE(v1, v2, 'EUCLIDEAN') AS output FROM mydataset.t1
    ```
    
    This query produces the following output:
    
    ``` text
    +---------------+---------------+-------------------+
    | v1            | v2            | output            |
    +---------------+---------------+-------------------|
    | [4.1,0.5,1.0] | [3.0,0.0,2.5] | 1.926136028425822 |
    +------------+------------------+-------------------+
    ```
