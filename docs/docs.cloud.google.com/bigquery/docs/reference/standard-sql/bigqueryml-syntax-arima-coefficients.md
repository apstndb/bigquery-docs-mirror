# The ML.ARIMA\_COEFFICIENTS function

This document describes the `  ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS  ` function, which lets you see the ARIMA coefficients and the weights of the external regressors for `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` and `  ARIMA_PLUS_XREG  ` time series models.

## Syntax

``` sql
ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS(
  MODEL `PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MODEL`
)
```

### Arguments

`  ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS  ` takes the following arguments:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID.
  - `  DATASET  ` : the BigQuery dataset that contains the model.
  - `  MODEL  ` : the name of the model.

## Output

`  ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS  ` returns the following columns:

  - `  time_series_id_col  ` or `  time_series_id_cols  ` : a value that contains the identifiers of a time series. `  time_series_id_col  ` can be an `  INT64  ` or `  STRING  ` value. `  time_series_id_cols  ` can be an `  ARRAY<INT64>  ` or `  ARRAY<STRING>  ` value. Only present when forecasting multiple time series simultaneously. The column names and types are inherited from the `  TIME_SERIES_ID_COL  ` option as specified in the model creation query.
  - `  ar_coefficients  ` : an `  ARRAY<FLOAT64>  ` value that contains the autoregressive coefficients, which corresponds to non-seasonal p.
  - `  ma_coefficients  ` : an `  ARRAY<FLOAT64>  ` value that contains the moving-average coefficients, which corresponds to non-seasonal q.
  - `  intercept_or_drift  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` value that contains the constant term of the ARIMA model. By definition, the constant term is called `  intercept  ` when non-seasonal d is `  0  ` , and `  drift  ` when non-seasonal d is `  1  ` . `  intercept_or_drift  ` is always `  0  ` when non-seasonal d is `  2  ` .
  - `  processed_input  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the name of the model feature input column. The value of this column matches the name of the feature column provided in the [`  query_statement  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#query_statement) that was used when the model was trained.
  - `  weight  ` : when the `  processed_input  ` value is numerical, `  weight  ` contains a `  FLOAT64  ` value and the `  category_weights  ` column contains `  NULL  ` values. When the `  processed_input  ` value is non-numerical and has been converted to dummy encoding, the `  weight  ` column is `  NULL  ` and the `  category_weights  ` column contains the category names and weights for each category.
  - `  category_weights.category  ` : a `  STRING  ` value that contains the category name if the `  processed_input  ` value is non-numeric.
  - `  category_weights.weight  ` : a `  FLOAT64  ` that contains the category's weight if the `  processed_input  ` value is non-numeric.

**Note:** For trained `  ARIMA_PLUS  ` models, this function returns the ARIMA coefficients for all time series, in ascending order of the `  time_series_id_col  ` or `  time_series_id_cols  ` value.

## Example

The following example retrieves the model coefficients information from the model `  mydataset.mymodel  ` in your default project:

``` text
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.ARIMA_COEFFICIENTS(MODEL `mydataset.mymodel`)
```
