The [HyperLogLog++ algorithm (HLL++)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) estimates [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) from sketches.

HLL++ functions are approximate aggregate functions. Approximate aggregation typically requires less memory than exact aggregation functions, like [`  COUNT(DISTINCT)  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aggregate_functions#count) , but also introduces statistical error. This makes HLL++ functions appropriate for large data streams for which linear memory usage is impractical, as well as for data that is already approximate.

A data sketch is a compact summary of a data aggregation. If you don't need materialized sketches, you can alternatively use an [approximate aggregate function with system-defined precision](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/approximate_aggregate_functions) , such as [`  APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/approximate_aggregate_functions#approx_count_distinct) . However, `  APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT  ` doesn't allow partial aggregations, re-aggregations, and custom precision.

GoogleSQL for BigQuery supports the following HLL++ functions.

## `     HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT    `

``` text
HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT(sketch)
```

**Description**

A scalar function that extracts a cardinality estimate of a single [HLL++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) sketch.

If `  sketch  ` is `  NULL  ` , this function returns a cardinality estimate of `  0  ` .

**Supported input types**

`  BYTES  `

**Return type**

`  INT64  `

**Example**

The following query returns the number of distinct users for each country who have at least one invoice.

``` text
SELECT
  country,
  HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT(HLL_sketch) AS distinct_customers_with_open_invoice
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      country,
      HLL_COUNT.INIT(customer_id) AS hll_sketch
    FROM
      UNNEST(
        ARRAY<STRUCT<country STRING, customer_id STRING, invoice_id STRING>>[
          ('UA', 'customer_id_1', 'invoice_id_11'),
          ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
          ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_22'),
          ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_23'),
          ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
          ('UA', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_24')])
    GROUP BY country
  );

/*---------+--------------------------------------+
 | country | distinct_customers_with_open_invoice |
 +---------+--------------------------------------+
 | UA      |                                    2 |

 +---------+--------------------------------------*/
```

## `     HLL_COUNT.INIT    `

``` text
HLL_COUNT.INIT(input [, precision])
```

**Description**

An aggregate function that takes one or more `  input  ` values and aggregates them into a [HLL++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) sketch. Each sketch is represented using the `  BYTES  ` data type. You can then merge sketches using `  HLL_COUNT.MERGE  ` or `  HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL  ` . If no merging is needed, you can extract the final count of distinct values from the sketch using `  HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT  ` .

This function supports an optional parameter, `  precision  ` . This parameter defines the accuracy of the estimate at the cost of additional memory required to process the sketches or store them on disk. The range for this value is `  10  ` to `  24  ` . The default value is `  15  ` . For more information about precision, see [Precision for sketches](/bigquery/docs/sketches#precision_hll) .

If the input is `  NULL  ` , this function returns `  NULL  ` .

For more information, see [HyperLogLog in Practice: Algorithmic Engineering of a State of The Art Cardinality Estimation Algorithm](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) .

**Supported input types**

  - `  INT64  `
  - `  NUMERIC  `
  - `  BIGNUMERIC  `
  - `  STRING  `
  - `  BYTES  `

**Return type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

The following query creates HLL++ sketches that count the number of distinct users with at least one invoice per country.

``` text
SELECT
  country,
  HLL_COUNT.INIT(customer_id, 10)
    AS hll_sketch
FROM
  UNNEST(
    ARRAY<STRUCT<country STRING, customer_id STRING, invoice_id STRING>>[
      ('UA', 'customer_id_1', 'invoice_id_11'),
      ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_22'),
      ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_23'),
      ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
      ('UA', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_24')])
GROUP BY country;

/*---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## `     HLL_COUNT.MERGE    `

``` text
HLL_COUNT.MERGE(sketch)
```

**Description**

An aggregate function that returns the cardinality of several [HLL++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) sketches by computing their union.

Each `  sketch  ` must be initialized on the same type. Attempts to merge sketches for different types results in an error. For example, you can't merge a sketch initialized from `  INT64  ` data with one initialized from `  STRING  ` data.

If the merged sketches were initialized with different precisions, the precision will be downgraded to the lowest precision involved in the merge.

This function ignores `  NULL  ` values when merging sketches. If the merge happens over zero rows or only over `  NULL  ` values, the function returns `  0  ` .

**Supported input types**

`  BYTES  `

**Return type**

`  INT64  `

**Example**

The following query counts the number of distinct users across all countries who have at least one invoice.

``` text
SELECT HLL_COUNT.MERGE(hll_sketch) AS distinct_customers_with_open_invoice
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      country,
      HLL_COUNT.INIT(customer_id) AS hll_sketch
    FROM
      UNNEST(
        ARRAY<STRUCT<country STRING, customer_id STRING, invoice_id STRING>>[
          ('UA', 'customer_id_1', 'invoice_id_11'),
          ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
          ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_22'),
          ('CZ', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_23'),
          ('BR', 'customer_id_3', 'invoice_id_31'),
          ('UA', 'customer_id_2', 'invoice_id_24')])
    GROUP BY country
  );

/*--------------------------------------+

 +--------------------------------------*/
```

## `     HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL    `

``` text
HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL(sketch)
```

**Description**

An aggregate function that takes one or more [HLL++](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/40671.pdf) `  sketch  ` inputs and merges them into a new sketch.

Each `  sketch  ` must be initialized on the same type. Attempts to merge sketches for different types results in an error. For example, you can't merge a sketch initialized from `  INT64  ` data with one initialized from `  STRING  ` data.

If the merged sketches were initialized with different precisions, the precision will be downgraded to the lowest precision involved in the merge. For example, if `  MERGE_PARTIAL  ` encounters sketches of precision 14 and 15, the returned new sketch will have precision 14.

This function returns `  NULL  ` if there is no input or all inputs are `  NULL  ` .

**Supported input types**

`  BYTES  `

**Return type**

`  BYTES  `

**Example**

The following query returns an HLL++ sketch that counts the number of distinct users who have at least one invoice across all countries.

``` text
SELECT HLL_COUNT.MERGE_PARTIAL(HLL_sketch) AS distinct_customers_with_open_invoice
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      country,
      HLL_COUNT.INIT(customer_id) AS hll_sketch
    FROM
