A [Model Context Protocol (MCP) server](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/server-concepts) acts as a proxy between an external service that provides context, data, or capabilities to a Large Language Model (LLM) or AI application. MCP servers connect AI applications to external systems such as databases and web services, translating their responses into a format that the AI application can understand.

BigQuery MCP server provides tools to interact with BigQuery.

### Server Endpoints

An MCP service endpoint is the network address and communication interface (usually a URL) of the MCP server that an AI application (the Host for the MCP client) uses to establish a secure, standardized connection. It is the point of contact for the LLM to request context, call a tool, or access a resource. Google MCP endpoints can be global or regional.

The bigquery.googleapis.com MCP server has the following MCP endpoint:

  - https://bigquery.googleapis.com/mcp

### MCP Tools

An [MCP tool](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/legacy/concepts/tools) is a function or executable capability that an MCP server exposes to a LLM or AI application to perform an action in the real world.

To view the tools' details for the bigquery.googleapis.com MCP server, head to the [tools overview](/bigquery/docs/reference/mcp/tools_overview) section.
