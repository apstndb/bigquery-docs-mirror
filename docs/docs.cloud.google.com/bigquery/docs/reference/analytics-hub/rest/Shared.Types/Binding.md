`  role  `

`  string  `

Role that is assigned to the list of `  members  ` , or principals. For example, `  roles/viewer  ` , `  roles/editor  ` , or `  roles/owner  ` .

For an overview of the IAM roles and permissions, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/roles-overview) . For a list of the available pre-defined roles, see [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles) .

`  members[]  `

`  string  `

Specifies the principals requesting access for a Google Cloud resource. `  members  ` can have the following values:

  - `  allUsers  ` : A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account.

  - `  allAuthenticatedUsers  ` : A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. Does not include identities that come from external identity providers (IdPs) through identity federation.

  - `  user:{emailid}  ` : An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, `  alice@example.com  ` .

<!-- end list -->

  - `  serviceAccount:{emailid}  ` : An email address that represents a Google service account. For example, `  my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com  ` .

  - `  serviceAccount:{projectid}.svc.id.goog[{namespace}/{kubernetes-sa}]  ` : An identifier for a [Kubernetes service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/kubernetes-service-accounts) . For example, `  my-project.svc.id.goog[my-namespace/my-kubernetes-sa]  ` .

  - `  group:{emailid}  ` : An email address that represents a Google group. For example, `  admins@example.com  ` .

<!-- end list -->

  - `  domain:{domain}  ` : The G Suite domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. For example, `  google.com  ` or `  example.com  ` .

<!-- end list -->

  - `  principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}  ` : A single identity in a workforce identity pool.

  - `  principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/group/{groupId}  ` : All workforce identities in a group.

  - `  principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}  ` : All workforce identities with a specific attribute value.

  - `  principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/*  ` : All identities in a workforce identity pool.

  - `  principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{projectNumber}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}  ` : A single identity in a workload identity pool.

  - `  principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{projectNumber}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/group/{groupId}  ` : A workload identity pool group.

  - `  principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{projectNumber}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/attribute.{attribute_name}/{attribute_value}  ` : All identities in a workload identity pool with a certain attribute.

  - `  principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/{projectNumber}/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/{pool_id}/*  ` : All identities in a workload identity pool.

  - `  deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}  ` : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For example, `  alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901  ` . If the user is recovered, this value reverts to `  user:{emailid}  ` and the recovered user retains the role in the binding.

  - `  deleted:serviceAccount:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}  ` : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a service account that has been recently deleted. For example, `  my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com?uid=123456789012345678901  ` . If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to `  serviceAccount:{emailid}  ` and the undeleted service account retains the role in the binding.

  - `  deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}  ` : An email address (plus unique identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently deleted. For example, `  admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901  ` . If the group is recovered, this value reverts to `  group:{emailid}  ` and the recovered group retains the role in the binding.

  - `  deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/{pool_id}/subject/{subject_attribute_value}  ` : Deleted single identity in a workforce identity pool. For example, `  deleted:principal://iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/my-pool-id/subject/my-subject-attribute-value  ` .

`  condition  `

`  object ( Expr  ` )

The condition that is associated with this binding.

If the condition evaluates to `  true  ` , then this binding applies to the current request.

If the condition evaluates to `  false  ` , then this binding does not apply to the current request. However, a different role binding might grant the same role to one or more of the principals in this binding.

To learn which resources support conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-policies) .

## Expr

Represents a textual expression in the Common Expression Language (CEL) syntax. CEL is a C-like expression language. The syntax and semantics of CEL are documented at <https://github.com/google/cel-spec> .

Example (Comparison):

``` text
title: "Summary size limit"
description: "Determines if a summary is less than 100 chars"
expression: "document.summary.size() < 100"
```

Example (Equality):

``` text
title: "Requestor is owner"
description: "Determines if requestor is the document owner"
expression: "document.owner == request.auth.claims.email"
```

Example (Logic):

``` text
title: "Public documents"
description: "Determine whether the document should be publicly visible"
expression: "document.type != 'private' && document.type != 'internal'"
```

Example (Data Manipulation):

``` text
title: "Notification string"
description: "Create a notification string with a timestamp."
expression: "'New message received at ' + string(document.create_time)"
```

The exact variables and functions that may be referenced within an expression are determined by the service that evaluates it. See the service documentation for additional information.
