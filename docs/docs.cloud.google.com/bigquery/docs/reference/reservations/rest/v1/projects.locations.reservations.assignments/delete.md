Deletes a assignment. No expansion will happen.

Example:

  - Organization `  organizationA  ` contains two projects, `  project1  ` and `  project2  ` .
  - Reservation `  res1  ` exists and was created previously.
  - assignments.create was used previously to define the following associations between entities and reservations: `  <organizationA, res1>  ` and `  <project1, res1>  `

In this example, deletion of the `  <organizationA, res1>  ` assignment won't affect the other assignment `  <project1, res1>  ` . After said deletion, queries from `  project1  ` will still use `  res1  ` while queries from `  project2  ` will switch to use on-demand mode.
