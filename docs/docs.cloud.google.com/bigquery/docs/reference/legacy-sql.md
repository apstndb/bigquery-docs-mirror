# Legacy SQL Syntax, Functions and Operators

This document details legacy SQL query syntax, functions and operators. The preferred query syntax for BigQuery is [GoogleSQL syntax](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) . For more information, see [Legacy SQL feature availability](/bigquery/docs/legacy-sql-feature-availability) .

## Query syntax

**Note:** Keywords are *not* case-sensitive. In this document, keywords such as `  SELECT  ` are capitalized for illustration purposes.

### SELECT clause

The `  SELECT  ` clause specifies a list of expressions to be computed. Expressions in the `  SELECT  ` clause can contain field names, literals, and [function calls](#functions) (including [aggregate functions](#aggfunctions) and [window functions](#windowfunctions) ) as well as combinations of the three. The expression list is comma-separated.

Each expression can be given an alias by adding a space followed by an identifier after the expression. The optional `  AS  ` keyword can be added between the expression and the alias for improved readability. Aliases defined in a `  SELECT  ` clause can be referenced in the `  GROUP BY  ` , `  HAVING  ` , and `  ORDER BY  ` clauses of the query, but not by the `  FROM  ` , `  WHERE  ` , or `  OMIT RECORD IF  ` clauses nor by other expressions in the same `  SELECT  ` clause.

**Notes:**

  - If you use an [aggregate function](#aggfunctions) in your `  SELECT  ` clause, you must either use an aggregate function in all expressions or your query must have a `  GROUP BY  ` clause which includes all non-aggregated fields in your `  SELECT  ` clause as grouping keys. For example:
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      word,
      corpus,
      COUNT(word)
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    WHERE
      word CONTAINS "th"
    GROUP BY
      word,
      corpus; /* Succeeds because all non-aggregated fields are group keys. */
    ```
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      word,
      corpus,
      COUNT(word)
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    WHERE
      word CONTAINS "th"
    GROUP BY
      word; /* Fails because corpus is not aggregated nor is it a group key. */
    ```

  - You can use square brackets to escape [reserved words](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical#reserved_keywords) so that you can use them as field name and aliases. For example, if you have a column named "partition", which is a reserved word in BigQuery syntax, the queries referencing that field fail with obscure error messages unless you escape it with square brackets:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT [partition] FROM ...
    ```

##### Example

This example defines aliases in the `  SELECT  ` clause and then references one of them in the `  ORDER BY  ` clause. Notice that the *word* column can not be referenced using the *word\_alias* in the `  WHERE  ` clause; it must be referenced by name. The *len* alias also is not visible in the `  WHERE  ` clause. It would be visible to a `  HAVING  ` clause.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  word AS word_alias,
  LENGTH(word) AS len
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
WHERE
  word CONTAINS 'th'
ORDER BY
  len;
```

#### WITHIN modifier for aggregate functions

``` text
aggregate_function WITHIN RECORD [ [ AS ] alias ]
```

The `  WITHIN  ` keyword causes the aggregate function to aggregate across repeated values within each record. For every input record, exactly one aggregated output will be produced. This type of aggregation is referred to as *scoped aggregation* . Since scoped aggregation produces output for every record, non-aggregated expressions can be selected alongside scoped-aggregated expressions without using a `  GROUP BY  ` clause.

Most commonly you will use the `  RECORD  ` scope when using scoped aggregation. If you have a very complex nested, repeated schema, you may find a need to perform aggregations within sub-record scopes. This can be done by replacing the `  RECORD  ` keyword in the syntax above with the name of the node in your schema where you want the aggregation to be performed. For more information about that advanced behavior, see [Dealing with data](/bigquery/docs/data#within) .

##### Example

This example performs a scoped `  COUNT  ` aggregation and then filters and sorts the records by the aggregated value.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  repository.url,
  COUNT(payload.pages.page_name) WITHIN RECORD AS page_count
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.github_nested]
HAVING
  page_count > 80
ORDER BY
  page_count DESC;
```

### FROM clause

``` text
FROM
  [project_name:]datasetId.tableId [ [ AS ] alias ] |
  (subquery) [ [ AS ] alias ] |
  JOIN clause |
  FLATTEN clause |
  table wildcard function
```

The `  FROM  ` clause specifies the source data to be queried. BigQuery queries can execute directly over tables, over subqueries, over joined tables, and over tables modified by special-purpose operators described below. Combinations of these data sources can be queried using the [comma](#comma_as_union_all) , which is the `  UNION ALL  ` operator in BigQuery.

#### Referencing tables

When referencing a table, both *datasetId* and *tableId* must be specified; *project\_name* is optional. If *project\_name* is not specified, BigQuery defaults to the current project. If your project name includes a dash, you must surround the entire table reference with brackets.

##### Example

``` text
[my-dashed-project:dataset1.tableName]
```

Tables can be given an alias by adding a space followed by an identifier after the table name. The optional `  AS  ` keyword can be added between the *tableId* and the alias for improved readability.

When referencing columns from a table, you can use the simple column name or you can prefix the column name with either the alias, if you specified one, or with the *datasetId* and *tableId* as long as no *project\_name* was specified. The *project\_name* cannot be included in the column prefix because the colon character is not allowed in field names.

##### Examples

This example references a column with no table prefix.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  word
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare];
```

This example prefixes the column name with the *datasetId* and *tableId* . Notice that the *project\_name* cannot be included in this example. This method will only work if the dataset is in your current default project.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  samples.shakespeare.word
FROM
  samples.shakespeare;
```

This example prefixes the column name with a table alias.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  t.word
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare] AS t;
```

#### Integer-range partitioned tables

Legacy SQL supports using table decorators to address a specific partition in an integer-range partitioned table. The key to address a range partition is the start of the range.

The following example queries the range partition that starts with 30:

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  dataset.table$30;
```

Note that you cannot use legacy SQL to query across an entire integer-range partitioned table. Instead, the query returns an error like the following:

`  Querying tables partitioned on a field is not supported in Legacy SQL  `

#### Using subqueries

A *subquery* is a nested `  SELECT  ` statement wrapped in parentheses. The expressions computed in the `  SELECT  ` clause of the subquery are available to the outer query just as columns of a [table](#from_tables) would be available.

Subqueries can be used to compute aggregations and other expressions. The full range of SQL operators are available in the subquery. This means a subquery can itself contain other subqueries, subqueries can perform joins and grouping aggregations, etc.

#### Comma as `     UNION ALL    `

Unlike GoogleSQL, legacy SQL uses the comma as a `  UNION ALL  ` operator rather than a `  CROSS JOIN  ` operator. This is a legacy behavior that evolved because historically BigQuery did not support `  CROSS JOIN  ` and BigQuery users regularly needed to write `  UNION ALL  ` queries. In GoogleSQL, queries that perform unions are particularly verbose. Using the comma as the union operator allows such queries to be written much more efficiently. For example, this query can be used to run a single query over logs from multiple days.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  FORMAT_UTC_USEC(event.timestamp_in_usec) AS time,
  request_url
FROM
  [applogs.events_20120501],
  [applogs.events_20120502],
  [applogs.events_20120503]
WHERE
  event.username = 'root' AND
  NOT event.source_ip.is_internal;
```

Queries that union a large number of tables typically run more slowly than queries that process the same amount of data from a single table. The difference in performance can be up to 50 ms per additional table. A single query can union at most 1,000 tables.

#### Table wildcard functions

The term *table wildcard function* refers to a special type of function unique to BigQuery. These functions are used in the `  FROM  ` clause to match a collection of table names using one of several types of filters. For example, the `  TABLE_DATE_RANGE  ` function can be used to query only a specific set of daily tables. For more information on these functions, see [Table wildcard functions](#tablewildcardfunctions) .

#### FLATTEN operator

``` text
(FLATTEN([project_name:]datasetId.tableId, field_to_be_flattened))
(FLATTEN((subquery), field_to_be_flattened))
```

Unlike typical SQL-processing systems, BigQuery is designed to handle repeated data. Because of this, BigQuery users sometimes need to write queries that manipulate the structure of repeated records. One way to do this is by using the `  FLATTEN  ` operator.

`  FLATTEN  ` converts one node in the schema from repeated to optional. Given a record with one or more values for a repeated field, `  FLATTEN  ` will create multiple records, one for each value in the repeated field. All other fields selected from the record are duplicated in each new output record. `  FLATTEN  ` can be applied repeatedly in order to remove multiple levels of repetition.

For more information and examples, see [Dealing with data](/bigquery/docs/data#flatten) .

#### JOIN operator

BigQuery supports multiple `  JOIN  ` operators in each `  FROM  ` clause. Subsequent `  JOIN  ` operations use the results of the previous `  JOIN  ` operation as the left `  JOIN  ` input. Fields from any preceding `  JOIN  ` input can be used as keys in the `  ON  ` clauses of subsequent `  JOIN  ` operators.

##### JOIN types

BigQuery supports `  INNER  ` , `  [FULL|RIGHT|LEFT] OUTER  ` and `  CROSS JOIN  ` operations. If left unspecified, the default is `  INNER  ` .

`  CROSS JOIN  ` operations do not allow `  ON  ` clauses. `  CROSS JOIN  ` can return a large amount of data and might result in a slow and inefficient query or in a query that exceeds the maximum allowed per-query resources. Such queries will fail with an error. When possible, prefer queries that do not use `  CROSS JOIN  ` . For example, `  CROSS JOIN  ` is often used in places where [window functions](#windowfunctions) would be more efficient.

##### EACH modifier

The `  EACH  ` modifier is a hint that tells BigQuery to execute the `  JOIN  ` using multiple partitions. This is particularly useful when you know that both sides of the `  JOIN  ` are large. The `  EACH  ` modifier can't be used in `  CROSS JOIN  ` clauses.

`  EACH  ` used to be encouraged in many cases, but this is no longer the case. When possible, use `  JOIN  ` without the `  EACH  ` modifier for better performance. Use `  JOIN EACH  ` when your query has failed with a resources exceeded error message.

##### Semi-join and Anti-join

In addition to supporting `  JOIN  ` in the `  FROM  ` clause, BigQuery also supports two types of joins in the `  WHERE  ` clause: semi-join and anti-semi-join. A semi-join is specified using the `  IN  ` keyword with a subquery; anti-join, using the `  NOT IN  ` keywords.

###### Examples

The following query uses a semi-join to find ngrams where the first word in the ngram is also the second word in another ngram that has "AND" as the third word in the ngram.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  ngram
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.trigrams]
WHERE
  first IN (SELECT
              second
            FROM
              [bigquery-public-data:samples.trigrams]
            WHERE
              third = "AND")
LIMIT 10;
```

The following query uses a semi-join to return the number of women over age 50 who gave birth in the 10 states with the most births.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  mother_age,
  COUNT(mother_age) total
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
WHERE
  state IN (SELECT
              state
            FROM
              (SELECT
                 state,
                 COUNT(state) total
               FROM
                 [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
               GROUP BY
                 state
               ORDER BY
                 total DESC
               LIMIT 10))
  AND mother_age > 50
GROUP BY
  mother_age
ORDER BY
  mother_age DESC
```

To see the numbers for the other 40 states, you can use an anti-join. The following query is nearly identical to the previous example, but uses `  NOT IN  ` instead of `  IN  ` to return the number of women over age 50 who gave birth in the 40 states with the least births.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  mother_age,
  COUNT(mother_age) total
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
WHERE
  state NOT IN (SELECT
                  state
                FROM
                  (SELECT
                     state,
                     COUNT(state) total
                   FROM
                     [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
                   GROUP BY
                     state
                   ORDER BY
                     total DESC
                   LIMIT 10))
  AND mother_age > 50
GROUP BY
  mother_age
ORDER BY
  mother_age DESC
```

Notes:

  - BigQuery does not support correlated semi- or anti-semi-joins. The subquery can not reference any fields from the outer query.
  - The subquery used in a semi- or anti-semi-join must select exactly one field.
  - The types of the selected field and the field being used from the outer query in the `  WHERE  ` clause must match exactly. BigQuery will not do any type coercion for semi- or anti-semi-joins.

### WHERE clause

The `  WHERE  ` clause, sometimes called the predicate, filters records produced by the `  FROM  ` clause using a boolean expression. Multiple conditions can be joined by boolean `  AND  ` and `  OR  ` clauses, optionally surrounded by parentheses—()— to group them. The fields listed in a `  WHERE  ` clause do not need to be selected in the corresponding `  SELECT  ` clause and the `  WHERE  ` clause expression cannot reference expressions computed in the `  SELECT  ` clause of the query to which the `  WHERE  ` clause belongs.

**Note:** Aggregate functions cannot be used in the `  WHERE  ` clause. Use a [`  HAVING  `](#having) clause and an outer query if you need to filter on the output of an aggregate function.

##### Example

The following example uses a disjunction of boolean expressions in the `  WHERE  ` clause—the two expressions joined by an `  OR  ` operator. An input record will pass through the `  WHERE  ` filter if either of the expressions returns `  true  ` .

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  word
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
WHERE
  (word CONTAINS 'prais' AND word CONTAINS 'ing') OR
  (word CONTAINS 'laugh' AND word CONTAINS 'ed');
```

### OMIT RECORD IF clause

The `  OMIT RECORD IF  ` clause is a construct that is unique to BigQuery. It is particularly useful for dealing with nested, repeated schemas. It is similar to a `  WHERE  ` clause, but different in two important ways. First, it uses an exclusionary condition, which means that records are omitted if the expression returns `  true  ` , but kept if the expression returns `  false  ` or `  null  ` . Second, the `  OMIT RECORD IF  ` clause can (and usually does) use scoped aggregate functions in its condition.

In addition to filtering full records, `  OMIT...IF  ` can specify a more narrow scope to filter just portions of a record. This is done by using the name of a non-leaf node in your schema rather than `  RECORD  ` in your `  OMIT...IF  ` clause. This functionality is rarely used by BigQuery users. You can find more documentation about this advanced behavior linked from the [`  WITHIN  `](#within) documentation above.

If you use [`  OMIT...IF  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/legacy-sql#omit) to exclude a portion of a record in a repeating field, and the query also selects other independently repeating fields, BigQuery omits a portion of the other repeated records in the query. If you see the error `  Cannot perform OMIT IF on repeated scope <scope> with independently repeating pass through field <field>,  ` we recommend that you switch to GoogleSQL. For information about migrating `  OMIT...IF  ` statements to GoogleSQL, see [Migrating to GoogleSQL](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/migrating-from-legacy-sql#filtering_rows_with_omit_record_if) .

##### Example

Referring back to the example used for the `  WITHIN  ` modifier, `  OMIT RECORD IF  ` can be used to accomplish the same thing `  WITHIN  ` and `  HAVING  ` were used to do in that example.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  repository.url
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.github_nested]
OMIT RECORD IF
  COUNT(payload.pages.page_name) <= 80;
```

### GROUP BY clause

The `  GROUP BY  ` clause lets you group rows that have the same values for a given field or set of fields so that you can compute aggregations of related fields. Grouping occurs after the filtering performed in the `  WHERE  ` clause but before the expressions in the `  SELECT  ` clause are computed. The expression results cannot be used as group keys in the `  GROUP BY  ` clause.

##### Example

This query finds the top ten most common *first words* in the trigrams sample dataset. In addition to demonstrating the use of the `  GROUP BY  ` clause, it demonstrates how positional indexes can be used instead of field names in the `  GROUP BY  ` and `  ORDER BY  ` clauses.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  first,
  COUNT(ngram)
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.trigrams]
GROUP BY
  1
ORDER BY
  2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Aggregation performed using a `  GROUP BY  ` clause is called *grouped aggregation* . Unlike [scoped aggregation](#scopedaggregation) , grouped aggregation is common in most SQL processing systems.

#### The `     EACH    ` modifier

The `  EACH  ` modifier is a hint that tells BigQuery to execute the `  GROUP BY  ` using multiple partitions. This is particularly useful when you know that your dataset contains a large number of distinct values for the group keys.

`  EACH  ` used to be encouraged in many cases, but this is no longer the case. Using `  GROUP BY  ` without the `  EACH  ` modifier usually provides better performance. Use `  GROUP EACH BY  ` when your query has failed with a resources exceeded error message.

#### The `     ROLLUP    ` function

When the `  ROLLUP  ` function is used, BigQuery adds extra rows to the query result that represent *rolled up* aggregations. All fields listed after `  ROLLUP  ` must be enclosed in a single set of parentheses. In rows added because of the `  ROLLUP  ` function, `  NULL  ` indicates the columns for which the aggregation is rolled up.

##### Example

This query generates per-year counts of male and female births from the sample natality dataset.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  year,
  is_male,
  COUNT(1) as count
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
WHERE
  year >= 2000
  AND year <= 2002
GROUP BY
  ROLLUP(year, is_male)
ORDER BY
  year,
  is_male;
```

These are the results of the query. Notice that there are rows where one or both of the group keys are `  NULL  ` . These rows are the *rollup* rows.

``` text
+------+---------+----------+
| year | is_male |  count   |
+------+---------+----------+
| NULL |    NULL | 12122730 |
| 2000 |    NULL |  4063823 |
| 2000 |   false |  1984255 |
| 2000 |    true |  2079568 |
| 2001 |    NULL |  4031531 |
| 2001 |   false |  1970770 |
| 2001 |    true |  2060761 |
| 2002 |    NULL |  4027376 |
| 2002 |   false |  1966519 |
| 2002 |    true |  2060857 |
+------+---------+----------+
```

When using the `  ROLLUP  ` function, you can use the `  GROUPING  ` function to distinguish between rows that were added because of the `  ROLLUP  ` function and rows that actually have a `  NULL  ` value for the group key.

##### Example

This query adds the `  GROUPING  ` function to the previous example to better identify the rows added because of the `  ROLLUP  ` function.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  year,
  GROUPING(year) as rollup_year,
  is_male,
  GROUPING(is_male) as rollup_gender,
  COUNT(1) as count
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
WHERE
  year >= 2000
  AND year <= 2002
GROUP BY
  ROLLUP(year, is_male)
ORDER BY
  year,
  is_male;
```

These are the result the new query returns.

``` text
+------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+
| year | rollup_year | is_male | rollup_gender |  count   |
+------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+
| NULL |           1 |    NULL |             1 | 12122730 |
| 2000 |           0 |    NULL |             1 |  4063823 |
| 2000 |           0 |   false |             0 |  1984255 |
| 2000 |           0 |    true |             0 |  2079568 |
| 2001 |           0 |    NULL |             1 |  4031531 |
| 2001 |           0 |   false |             0 |  1970770 |
| 2001 |           0 |    true |             0 |  2060761 |
| 2002 |           0 |    NULL |             1 |  4027376 |
| 2002 |           0 |   false |             0 |  1966519 |
| 2002 |           0 |    true |             0 |  2060857 |
+------+-------------+---------+---------------+----------+
```

**Notes:**

  - Non-aggregated fields in the `  SELECT  ` clause *must* be listed in the `  GROUP BY  ` clause.
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      word,
      corpus,
      COUNT(word)
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    WHERE
      word CONTAINS "th"
    GROUP BY
      word,
      corpus; /* Succeeds because all non-aggregated fields are group keys. */
    ```
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      word,
      corpus,
      COUNT(word)
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    WHERE
      word CONTAINS "th"
    GROUP BY
      word;  /* Fails because corpus is not aggregated nor is it a group key. */
    ```

  - Expressions computed in the `  SELECT  ` clause cannot be used in the corresponding `  GROUP BY  ` clause.
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      word,
      corpus,
      COUNT(word) word_count
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    WHERE
      word CONTAINS "th"
    GROUP BY
      word,
      corpus,
      word_count;  /* Fails because word_count is not visible to this GROUP BY clause. */
    ```

  - Grouping by float and double values is not supported, because the equality function for those types is not well-defined.

  - Because the system is interactive, queries that produce a large number of groups might fail. The use of the `  TOP  ` [function](#top-function) instead of `  GROUP BY  ` might solve some scaling problems.

### HAVING clause

The `  HAVING  ` clause behaves exactly like the [`  WHERE  `](#where) clause except that it is evaluated after the `  SELECT  ` clause so the results of all computed expressions are visible to the `  HAVING  ` clause. The HAVING clause can only refer to outputs of the corresponding `  SELECT  ` clause.

##### Example

This query computes the most common *first* words in the ngram sample dataset that contain the letter a and occur at most 10,000 times.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  first,
  COUNT(ngram) ngram_count
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.trigrams]
GROUP BY
  1
HAVING
  first contains "a"
  AND ngram_count < 10000
ORDER BY
  2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### ORDER BY clause

The `  ORDER BY  ` clause sorts the results of a query in ascending or descending order using one or more key fields. To sort by multiple fields or aliases, enter them as a comma-separated list. The results are sorted on the fields in the order in which they are listed. Use `  DESC  ` (descending) or `  ASC  ` (ascending) to specify the sort direction. `  ASC  ` is the default. A different sort direction can be specified for each sort key.

The `  ORDER BY  ` clause is evaluated after the `  SELECT  ` clause so it can reference the output of any expression computed in the `  SELECT  ` . If a field is given an alias in the `  SELECT  ` clause, the alias must be used in the `  ORDER BY  ` clause.

### LIMIT clause

The `  LIMIT  ` clause limits the number of rows in the returned result set. Since BigQuery queries regularly operate over very large numbers of rows, `  LIMIT  ` is a good way to avoid long-running queries by processing only a subset of the rows.

**Notes:**

  - The `  LIMIT  ` clause will stop processing and return results when it satisfies your requirements. This can reduce processing time for some queries, but when you specify aggregate functions such as COUNT or `  ORDER BY  ` clauses, the full result set must still be processed before returning results. The `  LIMIT  ` clause is the last to be evaluated.
  - A query with a `  LIMIT  ` clause may still be non-deterministic if there is no operator in the query that guarantees the ordering of the output result set. This is because BigQuery executes using a large number of parallel workers. The order in which parallel jobs return is not guaranteed.
  - The `  LIMIT  ` clause cannot contain any functions; it takes only a numeric constant.
  - When the `  LIMIT  ` clause is used, the total bytes processed and the bytes billed can vary for the same query.

## Query grammar

The individual clauses of BigQuery `  SELECT  ` statements are described in detail [above](#select-syntax) . Here we present the full grammar of `  SELECT  ` statements in a compact form with links back to the individual sections.

``` text
query:
    SELECT { * | field_path.* | expression } [ [ AS ] alias ] [ , ... ]
    [ FROM from_body
      [ WHERE bool_expression ]
      [ OMIT RECORD IF bool_expression]
      [ GROUP [ EACH ] BY [ ROLLUP ] { field_name_or_alias } [ , ... ] ]
      [ HAVING bool_expression ]
      [ ORDER BY field_name_or_alias [ { DESC | ASC } ] [, ... ] ]
      [ LIMIT n ]
    ];

from_body:
    {
      from_item [, ...] |  # Warning: Comma means UNION ALL here
      from_item [ join_type ] JOIN [ EACH ] from_item [ ON join_predicate ] |
      (FLATTEN({ table_name | (query) }, field_name_or_alias)) |
      table_wildcard_function
    }

from_item:
    { table_name | (query) } [ [ AS ] alias ]

join_type:
    { INNER | [ FULL ] [ OUTER ] | RIGHT [ OUTER ] | LEFT [ OUTER ] | CROSS }

join_predicate:
    field_from_one_side_of_the_join = field_from_the_other_side_of_the_join [ AND ...]

expression:
    {
      literal_value |
      field_name_or_alias |
      function_call
    }

bool_expression:
    {
      expression_which_results_in_a_boolean_value |
      bool_expression AND bool_expression |
      bool_expression OR bool_expression |
      NOT bool_expression
    }
```

**Notation:**

  - Square brackets "\[ \]" indicate optional clauses.
  - Curly braces "{ }" enclose a set of options.
  - The vertical bar "|" indicates a logical OR.
  - A comma or keyword followed by an ellipsis within square brackets "\[, ... \]" indicates that the preceding item can repeat in a list with the specified separator.
  - Parentheses "( )" indicate literal parentheses.

## Supported functions and operators

Most `  SELECT  ` statement clauses support functions. Fields referenced in a function don't need to be listed in any `  SELECT  ` clause. Therefore, the following query is valid, even though the `  clicks  ` field is not displayed directly:

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT country, SUM(clicks) FROM table GROUP BY country;
```

## Aggregate functions

Aggregate functions return values that represent summaries of larger sets of data, which makes these functions particularly useful for analyzing logs. An aggregate function operates against a collection of values and returns a single value per table, group, or scope:

  - Table aggregation
    
    Uses an aggregate function to summarize all qualifying rows in the table. For example:
    
    `  SELECT COUNT(f1) FROM ds.Table;  `

  - Group aggregation
    
    Uses an aggregate function and a `  GROUP BY  ` clause that specifies a non-aggregated field to summarize rows by group. For example:
    
    `  SELECT COUNT(f1) FROM ds.Table GROUP BY b1;  `
    
    The [TOP](/bigquery/docs/query-reference#top-function) function represents a specialized case of group aggregation.

  - Scoped aggregation
    
    *This feature applies only to tables that have [nested fields](/bigquery/docs/data#nested) .  
    * Uses an aggregate function and the [`  WITHIN  `](/bigquery/docs/data#within) keyword to aggregate repeated values within a defined scope. For example:
    
    `  SELECT COUNT(m1.f2) WITHIN RECORD FROM Table;  `
    
    The scope can be `  RECORD  ` , which corresponds to entire row, or a node (repeated field in a row). Aggregation functions operate over the values within the scope and return aggregated results for each record or node.

You can apply a restriction to an aggregate function using one of the following options:

  - An alias in a subselect query. The restriction is specified in the outer `  WHERE  ` clause.
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT corpus, count_corpus_words
    FROM
      (SELECT corpus, count(word) AS count_corpus_words
      FROM [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
      GROUP BY corpus) AS sub_shakespeare
    WHERE count_corpus_words > 4000
    ```

  - An alias in a [HAVING clause](/bigquery/query-reference#having) .
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT corpus, count(word) AS count_corpus_words
    FROM [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    GROUP BY corpus
    HAVING count_corpus_words > 4000;
    ```

You can also refer to an alias in the `  GROUP BY  ` or `  ORDER BY  ` clauses.

    Returns the total number of non-NULL values in the scope of the function.
    
    If you use the `  DISTINCT  ` keyword, the function returns the number of **distinct** values for the specified field. Note that the returned value for `  DISTINCT  ` is a **statistical approximation** and is not guaranteed to be exact.
    
    Use `  EXACT_COUNT_DISTINCT()  ` for an exact answer.
    
    If you require greater accuracy from `  COUNT(DISTINCT)  ` , you can specify a second parameter, `  n  ` , which gives the threshold below which exact results are guaranteed. By default, `  n  ` is 1000, but if you give a larger `  n  ` , you will get exact results for `  COUNT(DISTINCT)  ` up to that value of `  n  ` . However, giving larger values of `  n  ` will reduce scalability of this operator and may substantially increase query execution time or cause the query to fail.
    
    To compute the exact number of distinct values, use [EXACT\_COUNT\_DISTINCT](#exact_count_distinct) . Or, for a more scalable approach, consider using `  GROUP EACH BY  ` on the relevant field(s) and then applying `  COUNT(*)  ` . The `  GROUP EACH BY  ` approach is more scalable but might incur a slight up-front performance penalty.

  - `  COVAR_POP( numeric_expr1 , numeric_expr2 )  `  
    Computes the **population** covariance of the values computed by `  numeric_expr1  ` and `  numeric_expr2  ` .

  - `  COVAR_SAMP( numeric_expr1 , numeric_expr2 )  `  
    Computes the **sample** covariance of the values computed by `  numeric_expr1  ` and `  numeric_expr2  ` .

  - `  EXACT_COUNT_DISTINCT( field )  `  
    Returns the exact number of non-NULL, distinct values for the specified field. For better scalability and performance, use [COUNT(DISTINCT *field* )](#countdistinct) .

  - `  FIRST( expr )  `  
    Returns the first sequential value in the scope of the function.

  - `  GROUP_CONCAT( 'str' [, separator ])  `  
    Concatenates multiple strings into a single string, where each value is separated by the optional `  separator  ` parameter. If `  separator  ` is omitted, BigQuery returns a comma-separated string.
    
    If a string in the source data contains a double quote character, `  GROUP_CONCAT  ` returns the string with double quotes added. For example, the string `  a"b  ` would return as `  "a""b"  ` . Use `  GROUP_CONCAT_UNQUOTED  ` if you prefer that these strings do not return with double quotes added.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      GROUP_CONCAT(x)
    FROM (
      SELECT
        'a"b' AS x),
      (
      SELECT
        'cd' AS x);
    ```

  - `  GROUP_CONCAT_UNQUOTED( 'str' [, separator ])  `  
    Concatenates multiple strings into a single string, where each value is separated by the optional `  separator  ` parameter. If `  separator  ` is omitted, BigQuery returns a comma-separated string.
    
    Unlike `  GROUP_CONCAT  ` , this function will not add double quotes to returned values that include a double quote character. For example, the string `  a"b  ` would return as `  a"b  ` .
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      GROUP_CONCAT_UNQUOTED(x)
    FROM (
      SELECT
        'a"b' AS x),
      (
      SELECT
        'cd' AS x);
    ```

  - `  LAST( field )  `  
    Returns the last sequential value in the scope of the function.

  - `  MAX( field )  `  
    Returns the maximum value in the scope of the function.

  - `  MIN( field )  `  
    Returns the minimum value in the scope of the function.

  - `  NEST( expr )  `  
    Aggregates all values in the current aggregation scope into a repeated field. For example, the query `  "SELECT x, NEST(y) FROM ... GROUP BY x"  ` returns one output record for each distinct `  x  ` value, and contains a repeated field for all `  y  ` values paired with `  x  ` in the query input. The `  NEST  ` function requires a `  GROUP BY  ` clause.
    
    BigQuery automatically flattens query results, so if you use the `  NEST  ` function on the top level query, the results won't contain repeated fields. Use the `  NEST  ` function when using a subselect that produces intermediate results for immediate use by the same query.

  - `  NTH( n , field )  `  
    Returns the `  n  ` th sequential value in the scope of the function, where `  n  ` is a constant. The `  NTH  ` function starts counting at 1, so there is no zeroth term. If the scope of the function has less than `  n  ` values, the function returns `  NULL  ` .

  - `  QUANTILES( expr [, buckets ])  `  
    Computes approximate minimum, maximum, and quantiles for the input expression. `  NULL  ` input values are ignored. Empty or exclusively- `  NULL  ` input results in `  NULL  ` output. The number of quantiles computed is controlled with the optional `  buckets  ` parameter, which includes the minimum and maximum in the count. To compute approximate N-tiles, use N+1 `  buckets  ` . The default value of `  buckets  ` is 100. (Note: The default of 100 does not estimate percentiles. To estimate percentiles, use 101 `  buckets  ` at minimum.) If specified explicitly, `  buckets  ` must be at least 2.
    
    The fractional error per quantile is epsilon = 1 / `  buckets  ` , which means that the error decreases as the number of buckets increases. For example:
    
    ``` text
    QUANTILES(<expr>, 2) # computes min and max with 50% error.
    QUANTILES(<expr>, 3) # computes min, median, and max with 33% error.
    QUANTILES(<expr>, 5) # computes quartiles with 25% error.
    QUANTILES(<expr>, 11) # computes deciles with 10% error.
    QUANTILES(<expr>, 21) # computes vigintiles with 5% error.
    QUANTILES(<expr>, 101) # computes percentiles with 1% error.
    ```
    
    The `  NTH  ` function can be used to pick a particular quantile, but remember that `  NTH  ` is 1-based, and that `  QUANTILES  ` returns the minimum ("0th" quantile) in the first position, and the maximum ("100th" percentile or "Nth" N-tile) in the last position. For example, `  NTH(11, QUANTILES(expr, 21))  ` estimates the median of `  expr  ` , whereas `  NTH(20, QUANTILES(expr, 21))  ` estimates the 19th vigintile (95th percentile) of `  expr  ` . Both estimates have a 5% margin of error.
    
    To improve accuracy, use more buckets. For example, to reduce the margin of error for the previous calculations from 5% to 0.1%, use 1001 buckets instead of 21, and adjust the argument to the `  NTH  ` function accordingly. To calculate the median with 0.1% error, use `  NTH(501, QUANTILES(expr, 1001))  ` ; for the 95th percentile with 0.1% error, use `  NTH(951, QUANTILES(expr, 1001))  ` .

  - `  STDDEV( numeric_expr )  `  
    Returns the standard deviation of the values computed by `  numeric_expr  ` . Rows with a NULL value are not included in the calculation. The `  STDDEV  ` function is an alias for `  STDDEV_SAMP  ` .

  - `  STDDEV_POP( numeric_expr )  `  
    Computes the **population** standard deviation of the value computed by `  numeric_expr  ` . Use `  STDDEV_POP()  ` to compute the standard deviation of a dataset that encompasses the entire population of interest. If your dataset comprises only a representative sample of the population, use `  STDDEV_SAMP()  ` instead. For more information about population versus sample standard deviation, see [Standard deviation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) .

  - `  STDDEV_SAMP( numeric_expr )  `  
    Computes the **sample** standard deviation of the value computed by `  numeric_expr  ` . Use `  STDDEV_SAMP()  ` to compute the standard deviation of an entire population based on a representative sample of the population. If your dataset comprises the entire population, use `  STDDEV_POP()  ` instead. For more information about population versus sample standard deviation, see [Standard deviation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) .

  - `  SUM( field )  `  
    Returns the sum total of the values in the scope of the function. For use with numerical data types only.

  - `  TOP( field | alias [, max_values ][, multiplier ]) ... COUNT(*)  `  
    Returns the top *max\_records* records by frequency. See the [TOP description below](/bigquery/docs/query-reference#top-function) for details.

  - `  UNIQUE( expr )  `  
    Returns the set of unique, non-NULL values in the scope of the function in an undefined order. Similar to a large `  GROUP BY  ` clause without the `  EACH  ` keyword, the query will fail with a "Resources Exceeded" error if there are too many distinct values. Unlike `  GROUP BY  ` , however, the `  UNIQUE  ` function can be applied with scoped aggregation, allowing efficient operation on nested fields with a limited number of values.

  - `  VARIANCE( numeric_expr )  `  
    Computes the variance of the values computed by `  numeric_expr  ` . Rows with a NULL value are not included in the calculation. The `  VARIANCE  ` function is an alias for `  VAR_SAMP  ` .

  - `  VAR_POP( numeric_expr )  `  
    Computes the **population** variance of the values computed by `  numeric_expr  ` . For more information about population versus sample standard deviation, see [Standard deviation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) .

  - `  VAR_SAMP( numeric_expr )  `  
    Computes the **sample** variance of the values computed by `  numeric_expr  ` . For more information about population versus sample standard deviation, see [Standard deviation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) .

#### TOP() function

TOP is a function that is an alternative to the GROUP BY clause. It is used as simplified syntax for `  GROUP BY ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT ...  ` . Generally, the TOP function performs faster than the full `  ... GROUP BY ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT ...  ` query, but may only return approximate results. The following is the syntax for the TOP function:

``` text
TOP(field|alias[, max_values][,multiplier]) ... COUNT(*)
```

When using TOP in a `  SELECT  ` clause, you must include `  COUNT(*)  ` as one of the fields.

A query that uses the TOP() function can return only two fields: the TOP field, and the COUNT(\*) value.

  - `  field | alias  `  
    The field or alias to return.
  - `  max_values  `  
    \[ *Optional* \] The maximum number of results to return. Default is 20.
  - `  multiplier  `  
    A positive integer that increases the value(s) returned by `  COUNT(*)  ` by the multiple specified.

### TOP() examples

  - **Basic example queries that use `  TOP()  `**
    
    The following queries use `  TOP()  ` to return 10 rows.
    
    **Example 1:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      TOP(word, 10) as word, COUNT(*) as cnt
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    WHERE
      word CONTAINS "th";
    ```
    
    **Example 2:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      word, left(word, 3)
    FROM
      (SELECT TOP(word, 10) AS word, COUNT(*)
         FROM [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
         WHERE word CONTAINS "th");
    ```

  - **Compare `  TOP()  ` to `  GROUP BY...ORDER BY...LIMIT  `**
    
    The query returns, in order, the top 10 most frequently used words containing "th", and the number of documents the words was used in. The `  TOP  ` query will execute much faster:
    
    **Example without `  TOP()  ` :**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      word, COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM
      ds.Table
    WHERE
      word CONTAINS 'th'
    GROUP BY
      word
    ORDER BY
      cnt DESC LIMIT 10;
    ```
    
    **Example with `  TOP()  ` :**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      TOP(word, 10), COUNT(*)
    FROM
      ds.Table
    WHERE
      word contains 'th';
    ```

  - **Using the `  multiplier  ` parameter.**
    
    The following queries show how the `  multiplier  ` parameter affects the query result. The first query returns the number of births per month in Wyoming. The second query uses to `  multiplier  ` parameter to multiply the `  cnt  ` values by 100.
    
    **Example without the `  multiplier  ` parameter:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      TOP(month,3) as month, COUNT(*) as cnt
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
    WHERE
      state = "WY";
    ```
    
    **Returns:**
    
    ``` text
    +-------+-------+
    | month |  cnt  |
    +-------+-------+
    |   7   | 19594 |
    |   5   | 19038 |
    |   8   | 19030 |
    +-------+-------+
    ```
    
    **Example with the `  multiplier  ` parameter:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      TOP(month,3,100) as month, COUNT(*) as cnt
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
    WHERE
      state = "WY";
    ```
    
    **Returns:**
    
    ``` text
    +-------+---------+
    | month |   cnt   |
    +-------+---------+
    |   7   | 1959400 |
    |   5   | 1903800 |
    |   8   | 1903000 |
    +-------+---------+
    ```

**Note:** You must include `  COUNT(*)  ` in the `  SELECT  ` clause to use `  TOP  ` .

### Advanced examples

  - **Average and standard deviation grouped by condition**
    
    The following query returns the average and standard deviation of birth weights in Ohio in 2003, grouped by mothers who do and do not smoke.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      cigarette_use,
      /* Finds average and standard deviation */
      AVG(weight_pounds) baby_weight,
      STDDEV(weight_pounds) baby_weight_stdev,
      AVG(mother_age) mother_age
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
    WHERE
      year=2003 AND state='OH'
    /* Group the result values by those */
    /* who smoked and those who didn't.  */
    GROUP BY
      cigarette_use;
    ```

  - **Filter query results using an aggregated value**
    
    In order to filter query results using an aggregated value (for example, filtering by the value of a `  SUM  ` ), use the `  HAVING  ` function. `  HAVING  ` compares a value to a result determined by an aggregation function, as opposed to `  WHERE  ` , which operates on each row prior to aggregation.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      state,
      /* If 'is_male' is True, return 'Male', */
      /* otherwise return 'Female' */
      IF (is_male, 'Male', 'Female') AS sex,
      /* The count value is aliased as 'cnt' */
      /* and used in the HAVING clause below. */
      COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
    WHERE
      state != ''
    GROUP BY
      state, sex
    HAVING
      cnt > 3000000
    ORDER BY
      cnt DESC
    ```
    
    **Returns:**
    
    ``` text
    +-------+--------+---------+
    | state |  sex   |   cnt   |
    +-------+--------+---------+
    | CA    | Male   | 7060826 |
    | CA    | Female | 6733288 |
    | TX    | Male   | 5107542 |
    | TX    | Female | 4879247 |
    | NY    | Male   | 4442246 |
    | NY    | Female | 4227891 |
    | IL    | Male   | 3089555 |
    +-------+--------+---------+
    ```

## Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators take numeric arguments and return a numeric result. Each argument can be a numeric literal or a numeric value returned by a query. If the arithmetic operation evaluates to an undefined result, the operation returns `  NULL  ` .

## Bitwise functions

Bitwise functions operate at the level of individual bits and require numerical arguments. For more information about bitwise functions, see [Bitwise operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation) .

Three additional bitwise functions, `  BIT_AND  ` , `  BIT_OR  ` and `  BIT_XOR  ` , are documented in [aggregate functions](/bigquery/query-reference#aggfunctions) .

## Casting functions

Casting functions change the data type of a numeric expression. Casting functions are particularly useful for ensuring that arguments in a comparison function have the same data type.

### Syntax

Casting functions

[`  BOOLEAN()  `](#boolean)

Cast to boolean.

[`  BYTES()  `](#bytes)

Cast to bytes.

[`  CAST(expr AS type)  `](#cast)

Converts `  expr  ` into a variable of type `  type  ` .

[`  FLOAT()  `](#float)

Cast to double.

[`  HEX_STRING()  `](#hex_string)

Cast to hexadecimal string.

[`  INTEGER()  `](#integer)

Cast to integer.

[`  STRING()  `](#string)

Cast to string.

  - `  BOOLEAN( <numeric_expr> )  `
    
      - Returns `  true  ` if `  <numeric_expr>  ` is not 0 and not NULL.
      - Returns `  false  ` if `  <numeric_expr>  ` is 0.
      - Returns `  NULL  ` if `  <numeric_expr>  ` is NULL.

  - `  BYTES( string_expr )  `  
    Returns `  string_expr  ` as a value of type `  bytes  ` .

  - `  CAST( expr AS type )  `  
    Converts `  expr  ` into a variable of type `  type  ` .

  - `  FLOAT( expr )  `  
    Returns `  expr  ` as a double. The `  expr  ` can be a string like `  '45.78'  ` , but the function returns `  NULL  ` for non-numeric values.

  - `  HEX_STRING( numeric_expr )  `  
    Returns `  numeric_expr  ` as a hexadecimal string.

  - `  INTEGER( expr )  `  
    Casts `  expr  ` to a 64-bit integer.
    
      - Returns NULL if `  expr  ` is a string that doesn't correspond to an integer value.
      - Returns the number of microseconds since the unix epoch if `  expr  ` is a timestamp.

  - `  STRING( numeric_expr )  `  
    Returns `  numeric_expr  ` as a string.

## Comparison functions

Comparison functions return `  true  ` or `  false  ` , based on the following types of comparisons:

  - A comparison of two expressions.
  - A comparison of an expression or set of expressions to a specific criteria, such as being in a specified list, being NULL, or being a non-default optional value.

Some of the functions listed below return values other than `  true  ` or `  false  ` , but the values they return are based on comparison operations.

You can use either numeric or string expressions as arguments for comparison functions. (String constants must be enclosed in single or double quotes.) The expressions can be literals or values fetched by a query. Comparison functions are most often used as filtering conditions in `  WHERE  ` clauses, but they can be used in other clauses.

### Syntax

Comparison functions

[`  expr1 = expr2  `](#equals)

Returns `  true  ` if the expressions are equal.

[`  expr1 != expr2  `  
`  expr1 <> expr2  `](#not-equals)

[`  expr1 > expr2  `](#greater-than)

Returns `  true  ` if `  expr1  ` is greater than `  expr2  ` .

[`  expr1 < expr2  `](#less-than)

Returns `  true  ` if `  expr1  ` is less than `  expr2  ` .

[`  expr1 >= expr2  `](#greater-or-equal)

[`  expr IS NULL  `](#is-null)

Returns `  true  ` if `  expr  ` is NULL.

[`  expr IN()  `](#in)

Returns `  true  ` if `  expr  ` matches `  expr1  ` , `  expr2  ` , or any value in the parentheses.

[`  COALESCE()  `](#coalesce)

Returns the first argument that isn't NULL.

[`  GREATEST()  `](#greatest)

Returns the largest `  numeric_expr  ` parameter.

[`  IFNULL()  `](#ifnull)

If argument is not null, returns the argument.

    Returns `  true  ` if the expressions are equal.

  - `  expr1 != expr2  `  
    `  expr1 <> expr2  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if the expressions are not equal.

    Returns `  true  ` if `  expr1  ` is less than `  expr2  ` .

  - `  expr1 >= expr2  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if `  expr1  ` is greater than or equal to `  expr2  ` .

  - `  expr1 <= expr2  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if `  expr1  ` is less than or equal to `  expr2  ` .

  - `  expr1 BETWEEN expr2 AND expr3  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if the value of `  expr1  ` is greater than or equal to `  expr2  ` , and less than or equal to `  expr3  ` .

  - `  expr IS NULL  `

  - `  expr IN( expr1 , expr2, ...)  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if `  expr  ` matches `  expr1  ` , `  expr2  ` , or any value in the parentheses. The `  IN  ` keyword is an efficient shorthand for `  (expr = expr1 || expr = expr2 || ...)  ` . The expressions used with the `  IN  ` keyword must be constants and they must match the data type of `  expr  ` . The `  IN  ` clause can also be used to create semi-joins and anti-joins. For more information, see [Semi-join and Anti-join](#semi-joins) .

    To ignore `  NULL  ` values, use the `  IFNULL  ` function to change `  NULL  ` values to a value that doesn't affect the comparison. In the following code example, the `  IFNULL  ` function is used to change `  NULL  ` values to `  -1  ` , which doesn't affect the comparison between positive numbers.
    
    ``` text
    SELECT GREATEST(IFNULL(a,-1), IFNULL(b,-1)) FROM (SELECT 1 as a, NULL as b);
    ```

  - `  IFNULL( expr , null_default )  `  
    If `  expr  ` is not null, returns `  expr  ` , otherwise returns `  null_default  ` .

  - `  IS_INF( numeric_expr )  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if `  numeric_expr  ` is positive or negative infinity.

  - `  IS_NAN( numeric_expr )  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if `  numeric_expr  ` is the special `  NaN  ` numeric value.

  - `  IS_EXPLICITLY_DEFINED( expr )  `  
    This function is deprecated. Use `  expr IS NOT NULL  ` instead.

  - `  LEAST( numeric_expr1 , numeric_expr2 , ...)  `  
    Returns the smallest `  numeric_expr  ` parameter. All parameters must be numeric, and all parameters must be the same type. If any parameter is `  NULL  ` , this function returns `  NULL  `

  - `  NVL( expr , null_default )  `  
    If `  expr  ` is not null, returns `  expr  ` , otherwise returns `  null_default  ` . The `  NVL  ` function is an alias for `  IFNULL  ` .

## Date and time functions

The following functions enable date and time manipulation for UNIX timestamps, date strings and TIMESTAMP data types. For more information about working with the TIMESTAMP data type, see [Using TIMESTAMP](/bigquery/docs/timestamp) .

Date and time functions that work with UNIX timestamps operate on [UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) . Date and time functions return values based upon the UTC time zone.

### Advanced examples

  - **Convert integer timestamp results into human-readable format**
    
    The following query finds the top 5 moments in time in which the most Wikipedia revisions took place. In order to display results in a human-readable format, use BigQuery's `  FORMAT_UTC_USEC()  ` function, which takes a timestamp, in microseconds, as an input. This query multiplies the Wikipedia POSIX format timestamps (in seconds) by 1000000 to convert the value into microseconds.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      /* Multiply timestamp by 1000000 and convert */
      /* into a more human-readable format. */
      TOP (FORMAT_UTC_USEC(timestamp * 1000000), 5)
        AS top_revision_time,
      COUNT (*) AS revision_count
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.wikipedia];
    ```
    
    **Returns:**
    
    ``` text
    +----------------------------+----------------+
    |     top_revision_time      | revision_count |
    +----------------------------+----------------+
    | 2002-02-25 15:51:15.000000 |          20976 |
    | 2002-02-25 15:43:11.000000 |          15974 |
    | 2010-02-02 03:34:51.000000 |              3 |
    | 2010-02-02 01:04:59.000000 |              3 |
    | 2010-02-01 23:55:05.000000 |              3 |
    +----------------------------+----------------+
    ```

  - **Bucketing Results by Timestamp**
    
    It's useful to use date and time functions to group query results into buckets corresponding to particular years, months, or days. The following example uses the `  UTC_USEC_TO_MONTH()  ` function to display how many characters each Wikipedia contributor uses in their revision comments per month.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      contributor_username,
      /* Return the timestamp shifted to the
       * start of the month, formatted in
       * a human-readable format. Uses the
       * 'LEFT()' string function to return only
       * the first 7 characters of the formatted timestamp.
       */
      LEFT (FORMAT_UTC_USEC(
        UTC_USEC_TO_MONTH(timestamp * 1000000)),7)
        AS month,
      SUM(LENGTH(comment)) as total_chars_used
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.wikipedia]
    WHERE
      (contributor_username != '' AND
       contributor_username IS NOT NULL)
      AND timestamp > 1133395200
      AND timestamp < 1157068800
    GROUP BY
      contributor_username, month
    ORDER BY
      total_chars_used DESC;
    ```
    
    **Returns (truncated):**
    
    ``` text
    +--------------------------------+---------+-----------------------+
    |      contributor_username      |  month  | total_chars_used      |
    +--------------------------------+---------+-----------------------+

Returns a human-readable IP address in the form `  10.1.5.23  ` or `  2620:0:1009:1:216:36ff:feef:3f  ` .

[`  PARSE_PACKED_IP()  `](#parse-packed-ip)

Returns an IP address in [BYTES](/bigquery/data-types#bytes-type) .

  - `  FORMAT_IP( integer_value )  `  
    Converts 32 least significant bits of `  integer_value  ` to human-readable IPv4 address string. For example, `  FORMAT_IP(1)  ` will return string `  '0.0.0.1'  ` .
  - `  PARSE_IP( readable_ip )  `  
    Converts a string representing IPv4 address to unsigned integer value. For example, `  PARSE_IP('0.0.0.1')  ` will return `  1  ` . If string is not a valid IPv4 address, `  PARSE_IP  ` will return `  NULL  ` .

BigQuery supports writing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in packed strings, as 4- or 16-byte binary data in network byte order. The functions described below support parsing the addresses to and from human readable form. These functions work only on string fields with IPs.

### Syntax

  - `  FORMAT_PACKED_IP( packed_ip )  `  
    Returns a human-readable IP address, in the form `  10.1.5.23  ` or `  2620:0:1009:1:216:36ff:feef:3f  ` . **Examples:**
    
      - `  FORMAT_PACKED_IP('0123456789@ABCDE')  ` returns `  '3031:3233:3435:3637:3839:4041:4243:4445'  `
      - `  FORMAT_PACKED_IP('0123')  ` returns `  '48.49.50.51'  `

  - `  PARSE_PACKED_IP( readable_ip )  `  
    Returns an IP address in [BYTES](/bigquery/data-types#bytes-type) . If the input string is not a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address, `  PARSE_PACKED_IP  ` will return `  NULL  ` . **Examples:**
    
      - `  PARSE_PACKED_IP('48.49.50.51')  ` returns `  'MDEyMw=='  `
      - `  PARSE_PACKED_IP('3031:3233:3435:3637:3839:4041:4243:4445')  ` returns `  'MDEyMzQ1Njc4OUBBQkNERQ=='  `

## JSON functions

BigQuery's JSON functions give you the ability to find values within your stored JSON data, by using [JSONPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath#operators) -like expressions.

Storing JSON data can be more flexible than declaring all of your individual fields in your table schema, but can lead to higher costs. When you select data from a JSON string, you are charged for scanning the entire string, which is more expensive than if each field is in a separate column. The query is also slower since the entire string needs to be parsed at query time. But for ad-hoc or rapidly-changing schemas, the flexibility of JSON can be worth the extra cost.

Use JSON functions instead of BigQuery's [regular expression functions](#regularexpressionfunctions) if working with structured data, as JSON functions are easier to use.

### Syntax

JSON functions

[`  JSON_EXTRACT()  `](#json_extract)

Selects a value according to the JSONPath expression and returns a JSON string.

[`  JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR()  `](#json_extract_scalar)

Selects a value according to the JSONPath expression and returns a JSON scalar.

  - `  JSON_EXTRACT( json , json_path )  `  
    Selects a value in `  json  ` according to the JSONPath expression `  json_path  ` . `  json_path  ` must be a string constant. Returns the value in JSON string format.

  - `  JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR( json , json_path )  `  
    Selects a value in `  json  ` according to the JSONPath expression `  json_path  ` . `  json_path  ` must be a string constant. Returns a scalar JSON value.

## Logical operators

Logical operators perform binary or ternary logic on expressions. Binary logic returns `  true  ` or `  false  ` . Ternary logic accommodates `  NULL  ` values and returns `  true  ` , `  false  ` , or `  NULL  ` .

### Syntax

Logical operators

[`  expr AND expr  `](#and)

Returns `  true  ` if both expressions are true.

[`  expr OR expr  `](#or)

Returns `  true  ` if one or both expressions are true.

[`  NOT expr  `](#not)

  - `  expr AND expr  `
    
      - Returns `  true  ` if both expressions are true.
      - Returns `  false  ` if one or both of the expressions are false.
      - Returns `  NULL  ` if both expressions are NULL or one expression is true and the other is NULL.

  - `  expr OR expr  `
    
      - Returns `  true  ` if one or both expressions are true.
      - Returns `  false  ` if both expressions are false.
      - Returns `  NULL  ` if both expressions are NULL or one expression is false and the other is NULL.

  - `  NOT expr  `
    
      - Returns `  true  ` if the expression is false.
      - Returns `  false  ` if the expression if true.
      - Returns `  NULL  ` if the expression is NULL.
    
    You can use `  NOT  ` with other functions as an negation operator. For example, `  NOT IN(expr1, expr2)  ` or `  IS NOT NULL  ` .

### Advanced examples

  - **Bounding box query**
    
    The following query returns a collection of points within a rectangular bounding box centered around San Francisco (37.46, -122.50).
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      year, month,
      AVG(mean_temp) avg_temp,
      MIN(min_temperature) min_temp,
      MAX(max_temperature) max_temp
    FROM
      [weather_geo.table]
    WHERE
      /* Return values between a pair of */
      /* latitude and longitude coordinates */
      lat / 1000 > 37.46 AND
      lat / 1000 < 37.65 AND
      long / 1000 > -122.50 AND
      long / 1000 < -122.30
    GROUP BY
      year, month
    ORDER BY
      year, month ASC;
    ```

  - **Approximate Bounding Circle Query**
    
    Return a collection of up to 100 points within an approximated circle determined by the using the [Spherical Law of Cosines](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html) , centered around Denver Colorado (39.73, -104.98). This query makes use of BigQuery's mathematical and trigonometric functions, such as `  PI()  ` , `  SIN()  ` , and `  COS()  ` .
    
    Because the Earth isn't an absolute sphere, and longitude+latitude converges at the poles, this query returns an approximation that can be useful for many types of data.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      distance, lat, long, temp
    FROM
      (SELECT
        ((ACOS(SIN(39.73756700 * PI() / 180) *
               SIN((lat/1000) * PI() / 180) +
               COS(39.73756700 * PI() / 180) *
               COS((lat/1000) * PI() / 180) *
               COS((-104.98471790 -
               (long/1000)) * PI() / 180)) *
               180 / PI()) * 60 * 1.1515)
          AS distance,
         AVG(mean_temp) AS temp,
         AVG(lat/1000) lat, AVG(long/1000) long
    FROM
      [weather_geo.table]
    WHERE
      month=1 GROUP BY distance)
    WHERE
      distance < 100
    ORDER BY
      distance ASC
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

## Regular expression functions

BigQuery provides regular expression support using the [re2](https://github.com/google/re2) library; see that documentation for its [regular expression syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) .

Note that the regular expressions are global matches; to start matching at the beginning of a word you must use the ^ character.

### Syntax

Regular expression functions

[`  REGEXP_MATCH()  `](#regexp_match)

Returns true if the argument matches the regular expression.

[`  REGEXP_EXTRACT()  `](#regexp_extract)

Returns the portion of the argument that matches the capturing group within the regular expression.

[`  REGEXP_REPLACE()  `](#regexp_replace)

Replaces a substring that matches a regular expression.

  - `  REGEXP_MATCH(' str ', 'reg_exp' )  `  
    Returns true if *str* matches the regular expression. For string matching without regular expressions, use [CONTAINS](#stringfunctions) instead of REGEXP\_MATCH.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
       word,
       COUNT(word) AS count
    FROM
       [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    WHERE
       (REGEXP_MATCH(word,r'\w\w\'\w\w'))
    GROUP BY word
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```
    
    **Returns:**
    
    ``` text
    +-------+-------+
    | word  | count |
    +-------+-------+
    | ne'er |    42 |
    | we'll |    35 |
    | We'll |    33 |
    +-------+-------+
    ```

  - `  REGEXP_EXTRACT(' str ', ' reg_exp ')  `  
    Returns the portion of *str* that matches the capturing group within the regular expression.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
       REGEXP_EXTRACT(word,r'(\w\w\'\w\w)') AS fragment
    FROM
       [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    GROUP BY fragment
    ORDER BY fragment
    LIMIT 3;
    ```
    
    **Returns:**
    
    ``` text
    +----------+
    | fragment |
    +----------+
    | NULL     |
    | Al'ce    |
    | As'es    |
    +----------+
    ```

  - `  REGEXP_REPLACE(' orig_str ', ' reg_exp ', 'replace_str')  `  
    Returns a string where any substring of *orig\_str* that matches *reg\_exp* is replaced with *replace\_str* . For example, REGEXP\_REPLACE ('Hello', 'lo', 'p') returns Help.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      REGEXP_REPLACE(word, r'ne\'er', 'never') AS expanded_word
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    WHERE
      REGEXP_MATCH(word, r'ne\'er')
    GROUP BY expanded_word
    ORDER BY expanded_word
    LIMIT 5;
    ```
    
    **Returns:**
    
    ``` text
    +---------------+
    | expanded_word |
    +---------------+
    | Whenever      |
    | never         |
    | nevertheless  |
    | whenever      |
    +---------------+
    ```

### Advanced examples

  - **Filter result set by regular expression match**
    
    BigQuery's regular expression functions can be used to filter results in a `  WHERE  ` clause, as well as to display results in the `  SELECT  ` . The following example combines both of these regular expression use cases into a single query.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      /* Replace white spaces in the title with underscores. */
      REGEXP_REPLACE(title, r'\s+', '_') AS regexp_title, revisions
    FROM
      (SELECT title, COUNT(revision_id) as revisions
      FROM
        [bigquery-public-data:samples.wikipedia]
      WHERE
        wp_namespace=0
        /* Match titles that start with 'G', end with
         * 'e', and contain at least two 'o's.
         */
        AND REGEXP_MATCH(title, r'^G.*o.*o.*e$')
      GROUP BY
        title
      ORDER BY
        revisions DESC
      LIMIT 100);
    ```

  - **Using regular expressions on integer or float data**
    
    While BigQuery's regular expression functions only work for string data, it's possible to use the `  STRING()  ` function to cast integer or float data into string format. In this example, `  STRING()  ` is used to cast the integer value `  corpus_date  ` to a string, which is then altered by `  REGEXP_REPLACE  ` .
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      corpus_date,
      /* Cast the corpus_date to a string value  */
      REGEXP_REPLACE(STRING(corpus_date),
        '^16',
        'Written in the sixteen hundreds, in the year \''
        ) AS date_string
    FROM [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    /* Cast the corpus_date to string, */
    /* match values that begin with '16' */
    WHERE
      REGEXP_MATCH(STRING(corpus_date), '^16')
    GROUP BY
      corpus_date, date_string
    ORDER BY
      date_string DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

## String functions

String functions operate on string data. String constants must be enclosed with single or double quotes. String functions are case-sensitive by default. You can append `  IGNORE CASE  ` to the end of a query to enable case- insensitive matching. `  IGNORE CASE  ` works only on ASCII characters and only at the top level of the query.

Wildcards are not supported in these functions; for regular expression functionality, use [regular expression functions](#regularexpressionfunctions) .

    Returns the concatenation of two or more strings, or NULL if any of the values are NULL. **Example:** if `  str1  ` is `  Java  ` and `  str2  ` is `  Script  ` , `  CONCAT  ` returns `  JavaScript  ` .

  - `  expr CONTAINS ' str '  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if `  expr  ` contains the specified string argument. This is a case-sensitive comparison.

  - `  INSTR(' str1 ', ' str2 ')  `  
    Returns the one-based index of the first occurrence of *str2* in *str1* , or returns 0 if *str2* does not occur in *str1* .

  - `  LEFT(' str ', numeric_expr )  `  
    Returns the leftmost *numeric\_expr* characters of `  str  ` . If the number is longer than *str* , the full string will be returned. **Example:** `  LEFT('seattle', 3)  ` returns `  sea  ` .

  - `  LENGTH(' str ')  `  
    Returns a numerical value for the length of the string. **Example:** if `  str  ` is `  '123456'  ` , `  LENGTH  ` returns `  6  ` .

  - `  LOWER(' str ')  `  
    Returns the original string with all characters in lower case.

  - `  LPAD(' str1 ', numeric_expr , ' str2 ')  `  
    Pads `  str1  ` on the left with `  str2  ` , repeating `  str2  ` until the result string is exactly `  numeric_expr  ` characters. **Example:** `  LPAD('1', 7, '?')  ` returns `  ??????1  ` .

  - `  LTRIM(' str1 ' [, str2 ])  `  
    Removes characters from the left side of *str1* . If *str2* is omitted, `  LTRIM  ` removes spaces from the left side of *str1* . Otherwise, `  LTRIM  ` removes any characters in *str2* from the left side of *str1* (case-sensitive).
    
    **Examples:**
    
    `  SELECT LTRIM("Say hello", "yaS")  ` returns `  " hello"  ` .
    
    `  SELECT LTRIM("Say hello", " ySa")  ` returns `  "hello"  ` .

  - `  REPLACE(' str1 ', ' str2 ', ' str3 ')  `  
    Replaces all instances of *str2* within *str1* with *str3* .

  - `  RIGHT(' str ', numeric_expr )  `  
    Returns the rightmost *numeric\_expr* characters of `  str  ` . If the number is longer than the string, it will return the whole string. **Example:** `  RIGHT('kirkland', 4)  ` returns `  land  ` .

  - `  RPAD(' str1 ', numeric_expr , ' str2 ')  `  
    Pads `  str1  ` on the right with `  str2  ` , repeating `  str2  ` until the result string is exactly `  numeric_expr  ` characters. **Example:** `  RPAD('1', 7, '?')  ` returns `  1??????  ` .

  - `  RTRIM(' str1 ' [, str2 ])  `  
    Removes trailing characters from the right side of *str1* . If *str2* is omitted, `  RTRIM  ` removes trailing spaces from *str1* . Otherwise, `  RTRIM  ` removes any characters in *str2* from the right side of *str1* (case-sensitive).
    
    **Examples:**
    
    `  SELECT RTRIM("Say hello", "leo")  ` returns `  "Say h"  ` .
    
    `  SELECT RTRIM("Say hello ", " hloe")  ` returns `  "Say"  ` .

  - `  SPLIT(' str ' [, 'delimiter'])  `  
    Splits a string into repeated substrings. If `  delimiter  ` is specified, the `  SPLIT  ` function breaks `  str  ` into substrings, using `  delimiter  ` as the delimiter.

  - `  SUBSTR(' str ', index [, max_len ])  `  
    Returns a substring of `  str  ` , starting at `  index  ` . If the optional `  max_len  ` parameter is used, the returned string is a maximum of `  max_len  ` characters long. Counting starts at 1, so the first character in the string is in position 1 (not zero). If `  index  ` is `  5  ` , the substring begins with the 5th character from the left in `  str  ` . If `  index  ` is `  -4  ` , the substring begins with the 4th character from the right in `  str  ` . **Example:** `  SUBSTR(' awesome ', -4 , 4 )  ` returns the substring `  some  ` .

  - `  UPPER(' str ')  `  
    Returns the original string with all characters in upper case.

**Escaping special characters in strings**

To escape special characters, use one of the following methods:

  - Use `  '\x DD '  ` notation, where `  '\x'  ` is followed by the two-digit hex representation of the character.
  - Use an escaping slash in front of slashes, single quotes, and double quotes.
  - Use C-style sequences ( `  '\a', '\b', '\f', '\n', '\r', '\t',  ` and `  '\v'  ` ) for other characters.

Some examples of escaping:

``` text
'this is a space: \x20'
'this string has \'single quote\' inside it'
'first line \n second line'
"double quotes are also ok"
'\070' -> ERROR: octal escaping is not supported
```

## Table wildcard functions

Table wildcard functions are a convenient way to query data from a specific set of tables. A table wildcard function is equivalent to a comma-separated union of all the tables matched by the wildcard function. When you use a table wildcard function, BigQuery only accesses and charges you for tables that match the wildcard. Table wildcard functions are specified in the query's [FROM clause](/bigquery/query-reference#from) .

If you use table wildcard functions in a query, the functions no longer need to be contained in parentheses. For example, some of the following examples use parentheses, whereas others don't.

Cached results are not supported for queries against multiple tables using a wildcard function (even if the **Use Cached Results** option is checked). If you run the same wildcard query multiple times, you are billed for each query.

### Syntax

Table wildcard functions

[`  TABLE_DATE_RANGE()  `](#table-date-range)

Queries multiple daily tables that span a date range.

[`  TABLE_DATE_RANGE_STRICT()  `](#table-date-range-strict)

Queries multiple daily tables that span a date range, with no missing dates.

[`  TABLE_QUERY()  `](#table-query)

Queries tables whose names match a specified predicate.

  - `  TABLE_DATE_RANGE( prefix , timestamp1 , timestamp2 )  `  
    Queries daily tables that overlap with the time range between `  <timestamp1>  ` and `  <timestamp2>  ` .
    
    Table names must have the following format: `  <prefix><day>  ` , where `  <day>  ` is in the format `  YYYYMMDD  ` .
    
    You can use [date and time functions](/bigquery/query-reference#datetimefunctions) to generate the timestamp parameters. For example:
    
      - `  TIMESTAMP('2012-10-01 02:03:04')  `
      - `  DATE_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), -7, 'DAY')  `
    
    **Example: get tables between two days**
    
    This example assumes the following tables exist:
    
      - mydata.people20140325
      - mydata.people20140326
      - mydata.people20140327
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      name
    FROM
      TABLE_DATE_RANGE([myproject-1234:mydata.people],
                        TIMESTAMP('2014-03-25'),
                        TIMESTAMP('2014-03-27'))
    WHERE
      age >= 35
    ```
    
    Matches the following tables:
    
      - mydata.people20140325
      - mydata.people20140326
      - mydata.people20140327
    
    **Example: get tables in a two-day range up to "now"**
    
    This example assumes the following tables exist in a project named `  myproject-1234  ` :
    
      - mydata.people20140323
      - mydata.people20140324
      - mydata.people20140325
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      name
    FROM
      (TABLE_DATE_RANGE([myproject-1234:mydata.people],
                        DATE_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), -2, 'DAY'),
                        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()))
    WHERE
      age >= 35
    ```
    
    Matches the following tables:
    
      - mydata.people20140323
      - mydata.people20140324
      - mydata.people20140325

  - `  TABLE_DATE_RANGE_STRICT( prefix , timestamp1 , timestamp2 )  `  
    This function is equivalent to `  TABLE_DATE_RANGE  ` . The only difference is that if any daily table is missing in the sequence, `  TABLE_DATE_RANGE_STRICT  ` fails and returns a `  Not Found: Table <table_name>  ` error.
    
    **Example: error on missing table**
    
    This example assumes the following tables exist:
    
      - people20140325
      - people20140327
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      name
    FROM
      (TABLE_DATE_RANGE_STRICT([myproject-1234:mydata.people],
                        TIMESTAMP('2014-03-25'),
                        TIMESTAMP('2014-03-27')))
    WHERE age >= 35
    ```
    
    The above example returns an error "Not Found" for the table "people20140326".

  - `  TABLE_QUERY( dataset , expr )  `  
    Queries tables whose names match the supplied `  expr  ` . The `  expr  ` parameter must be represented as a string and must contain an expression to evaluate. For example, `  'length(table_id) < 3'  ` .
    
    **Example: match tables whose names contain "oo" and have a length greater than 4**
    
    This example assumes the following tables exist:
    
      - mydata.boo
      - mydata.fork
      - mydata.ooze
      - mydata.spoon
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      speed
    FROM (TABLE_QUERY([myproject-1234:mydata],
                      'table_id CONTAINS "oo" AND length(table_id) >= 4'))
    ```
    
    Matches the following tables:
    
      - mydata.ooze
      - mydata.spoon
    
    **Example: match tables whose names start with "boo", followed by 3-5 numeric digits**
    
    This example assumes the following tables exist in a project named `  myproject-1234  ` :
    
      - mydata.book4
      - mydata.book418
      - mydata.boom12345
      - mydata.boom123456789
      - mydata.taboo999
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      speed
    FROM
      TABLE_QUERY([myproject-1234:mydata],
                   'REGEXP_MATCH(table_id, r"^boo[\d]{3,5}")')
    ```
    
    Matches the following tables:
    
      - mydata.book418
      - mydata.boom12345

## URL functions

### Syntax

URL functions

[`  HOST()  `](#host)

Given a URL, returns the host name as a string.

[`  DOMAIN()  `](#domain)

Given a URL, returns the domain as a string.

[`  TLD()  `](#tld)

Given a URL, returns the top level domain plus any country domain in the URL.

  - `  HOST(' url_str ')  `  
    Given a URL, returns the host name as a string. **Example:** HOST('http://www.google.com:80/index.html') returns 'www.google.com'
  - `  DOMAIN(' url_str ')  `  
    Given a URL, returns the domain as a string. **Example:** DOMAIN('http://www.google.com:80/index.html') returns 'google.com'.
  - `  TLD(' url_str ')  `  
    Given a URL, returns the top level domain plus any country domain in the URL. **Example:** TLD('http://www.google.com:80/index.html') returns '.com'. TLD('http://www.google.co.uk:80/index.html') returns '.co.uk'.

Notes:

  - These functions don't perform reverse DNS lookup, so if you call these functions using an IP address the functions will return segments of the IP address rather than segments of the host name.
  - All of the URL parsing functions expect lower-case characters. Upper-case characters in the URL will result in a NULL or otherwise incorrect result. Consider passing input to this function through LOWER() if your data has mixed casing.

### Advanced example

**Parse domain names from URL data**

This query uses the `  DOMAIN()  ` function to return the most popular domains listed as repository homepages on GitHub. Note the use of HAVING to filter records using the result of the `  DOMAIN()  ` function. This is a useful function to determine referrer information from URL data.

**Examples:**

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  DOMAIN(repository_homepage) AS user_domain,
  COUNT(*) AS activity_count
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.github_timeline]
GROUP BY
  user_domain
HAVING
  user_domain IS NOT NULL AND user_domain != ''
ORDER BY
  activity_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Returns:**

``` text
+-----------------+----------------+
|   user_domain   | activity_count |
+-----------------+----------------+
| github.com      |         281879 |
| google.com      |          34769 |
| khanacademy.org |          17316 |
| sourceforge.net |          15103 |
| mozilla.org     |          14091 |
+-----------------+----------------+
```

To look specifically at TLD information, use the `  TLD()  ` function. This example displays the top TLDs that are not in a list of common examples.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  TLD(repository_homepage) AS user_tld,
  COUNT(*) AS activity_count
FROM
  [bigquery-public-data:samples.github_timeline]
GROUP BY
  user_tld
HAVING
  /* Only consider TLDs that are NOT NULL */
  /* or in our list of common TLDs */
  user_tld IS NOT NULL AND NOT user_tld
  IN ('','.com','.net','.org','.info','.edu')
ORDER BY
  activity_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Returns:**

``` text
+----------+----------------+
| user_tld | activity_count |
+----------+----------------+
| .de      |          22934 |
| .io      |          17528 |
| .me      |          13652 |
| .fr      |          12895 |
| .co.uk   |           9135 |
+----------+----------------+
```

## Window functions

Window functions, also known as analytic functions, enable calculations on a specific subset, or "window", of a result set. Window functions make it easier to create reports that include complex analytics such as trailing averages and running totals.

Each window function requires an `  OVER  ` clause that specifies the window top and bottom. The three components of the `  OVER  ` clause (partitioning, ordering, and framing) provide additional control over the window. Partitioning enables you to divide the input data into logical groups that have a common characteristic. Ordering enables you to order the results within a partition. Framing enables you to create a sliding window frame within a partition that moves relative to the current row. You can configure the size of the moving window frame based on a number of rows or a range of values, such as a time interval.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT <window_function>
  OVER (
      [PARTITION BY <expr>]
      [ORDER BY <expr> [ASC | DESC]]
      [<window-frame-clause>]
     )
```

  - `  PARTITION BY  `  
    Defines the base partition over which this function operates. Specify one or more comma-separated column names; one partition will be created for each distinct set of values for these columns, similar to a `  GROUP BY  ` clause. If `  PARTITION BY  ` is omitted, the base partition is all rows in the input to the window function.
    
    The `  PARTITION BY  ` clause also allows window functions to partition data and parallelize execution. If you wish to use a window function with `  allowLargeResults  ` , or if you intend to apply further joins or aggregations to the output of your window function, use `  PARTITION BY  ` to parallelize execution.
    
    `  JOIN EACH  ` and `  GROUP EACH BY  ` clauses can't be used on the output of window functions. To generate [large query results](/bigquery/docs/writing-results#large-results) when using window functions, you must use `  PARTITION BY  ` .

  - `  ORDER BY  `  
    Sorts the partition. If `  ORDER BY  ` is absent, there is no guarantee of any default sorting order. Sorting occurs at the partition level, before any window frame clause is applied. If you specify a `  RANGE  ` window, you should add an `  ORDER BY  ` clause. Default order is `  ASC  ` .
    
    `  ORDER BY  ` is optional in some cases, but certain window functions, such as [rank()](#rank) or [dense\_rank()](#dense_rank) , require the clause.
    
    If you use `  ORDER BY  ` without specifying `  ROWS  ` or `  RANGE  ` , `  ORDER BY  ` implies that the window extends from the beginning of the partition to the current row. In the absence of an `  ORDER BY  ` clause, the window is the entire partition.

  - `  <window-frame-clause>  `
    
    ``` text
    {ROWS | RANGE} {BETWEEN <start> AND <end> | <start> | <end>}
    ```
    
    A subset of the partition over which to operate. This can be the same size as the partition or smaller. If you use `  ORDER BY  ` without a `  window-frame-clause  ` , the default window frame is `  RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW  ` . If you omit both `  ORDER BY  ` and the `  window-frame-clause  ` , the default window frame is the entire partition.
    
      - `  ROWS  ` - Defines a window in terms of row position, relative to the current row. For example, to add a column showing the sum of the preceding 5 rows of salary values, you would query `  SUM(salary) OVER (ROWS BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)  ` . The set of rows typically includes the current row, but that is not required.
    
      - `  RANGE  ` - Defines a window in terms of a range of values in a given column, relative to that column's value in the current row. Only operates on numbers and dates, where date values are simple integers (microseconds since the epoch). Neighboring rows with the same value are called *peer* rows. Peer rows of the `  CURRENT ROW  ` are included in a window frame that specifies `  CURRENT ROW  ` . For example, if you specify the window end to be `  CURRENT ROW  ` and the following row in the window has the same value, it will be included in the function calculation.
    
      - `  BETWEEN <start> AND <end>  ` - A range, inclusive of the start and end rows. The range need not include the current row, but `  <start>  ` must precede or equal `  <end>  ` .
    
      - `  <start>  ` - Specifies the start offset for this window, relative to the current row. The following options are supported:
        
        ``` text
        {UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW | <expr> PRECEDING | <expr> FOLLOWING}
        ```
        
        where `  <expr>  ` is a positive integer, `  PRECEDING  ` indicates a preceding row number or range value, and `  FOLLOWING  ` indicates a following row number or range value. `  UNBOUNDED PRECEDING  ` means the first row of the partition. If the start precedes the window, it will be set to the first row of the partition.
    
      - `  <end>  ` - Specifies the end offset for this window, relative to the current row. The following options are supported:
        
        ``` text
        {UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING | CURRENT ROW | <expr> PRECEDING | <expr> FOLLOWING}
        ```
        
        where `  <expr>  ` is a positive integer, `  PRECEDING  ` indicates a preceding row number or range value, and `  FOLLOWING  ` indicates a following row number or range value. `  UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING  ` means the last row of the partition. If end is beyond the end of the window, it will be set to the last row of the partition.

Unlike aggregation functions, which collapse many input rows into one output row, window functions return one row of output for each row of input. This feature makes it easier to create queries that calculate running totals and moving averages. For example, the following query returns a running total for a small dataset of five rows defined by `  SELECT  ` statements:

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT name, value, SUM(value) OVER (ORDER BY value) AS RunningTotal
FROM
  (SELECT "a" AS name, 0 AS value),
  (SELECT "b" AS name, 1 AS value),
  (SELECT "c" AS name, 2 AS value),
  (SELECT "d" AS name, 3 AS value),
  (SELECT "e" AS name, 4 AS value);
```

Return value:

``` text
+------+-------+--------------+
| name | value | RunningTotal |
+------+-------+--------------+
| a    |     0 |            0 |
| b    |     1 |            1 |
| c    |     2 |            3 |
| d    |     3 |            6 |
| e    |     4 |           10 |
+------+-------+--------------+
```

The following example calculates a moving average of the values in the current row and the row preceding it. The window frame comprises two rows that move with the current row.

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT
  name,
  value,
  AVG(value)
    OVER (ORDER BY value
          ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
    AS MovingAverage
FROM
  (SELECT "a" AS name, 0 AS value),
  (SELECT "b" AS name, 1 AS value),
  (SELECT "c" AS name, 2 AS value),
  (SELECT "d" AS name, 3 AS value),
  (SELECT "e" AS name, 4 AS value);
```

Return value:

``` text
+------+-------+---------------+
| name | value | MovingAverage |
+------+-------+---------------+
| a    |     0 |           0.0 |
| b    |     1 |           0.5 |
| c    |     2 |           1.5 |
| d    |     3 |           2.5 |
| e    |     4 |           3.5 |
+------+-------+---------------+
```

Window functions

[`  AVG()  `  
`  COUNT(*)  `  
`  COUNT([DISTINCT])  `  
`  MAX()  `  
`  MIN()  `  
`  STDDEV()  `  
`  SUM()  `  
](#analytics)

The same operation as the corresponding [Aggregate functions](#aggfunctions) , but are computed over a window defined by the OVER clause.

[`  CUME_DIST()  `](#cume_dist)

Returns a double that indicates the cumulative distribution of a value in a group of values ...

[`  DENSE_RANK()  `](#dense_rank)

Returns the integer rank of a value in a group of values.

[`  FIRST_VALUE()  `](#first_value)

Returns the first value of the specified field in the window.

[`  LAG()  `](#lag)

Enables you to read data from a previous row within a window.

[`  LAST_VALUE()  `](#last_value)

Returns the last value of the specified field in the window.

[`  LEAD()  `](#lead)

Enables you to read data from a following row within a window.

[`  NTH_VALUE()  `](#nthvalue)

Returns the value of `  <expr>  ` at position `  <n>  ` of the window frame ...

[`  NTILE()  `](#ntile)

Divides the window into the specified number of buckets.

[`  PERCENT_RANK()  `](#percent_rank)

Returns the rank of the current row, relative to the other rows in the partition.

[`  PERCENTILE_CONT()  `](#percentile_cont)

Returns an interpolated value that would map to the percentile argument with respect to the window ...

[`  PERCENTILE_DISC()  `](#percentile_disc)

Returns the value nearest the percentile of the argument over the window.

[`  RANK()  `](#rank)

Returns the integer rank of a value in a group of values.

[`  RATIO_TO_REPORT()  `](#ratio-to-report)

Returns the ratio of each value to the sum of the values.

[`  ROW_NUMBER()  `](#row-number)

Returns the current row number of the query result over the window.

  - `  AVG( numeric_expr )  `  
    `  COUNT(*)  `  
    `  COUNT([DISTINCT] field )  `  
    `  MAX( field )  `  
    `  MIN( field )  `  
    `  STDDEV( numeric_expr )  `  
    `  SUM( field )  `  
      
    These window functions perform the same operation as the corresponding [Aggregate functions](#aggfunctions) , but are computed over a window defined by the OVER clause.
    
    Another significant difference is that the `  COUNT([DISTINCT] field )  ` function produces exact results when used as a window function, with behavior similar to the `  EXACT_COUNT_DISTINCT()  ` aggregate function.
    
    In the example query, the `  ORDER BY  ` clause causes the window to be computed from the start of the partition to the current row, which generates a cumulative sum for that year.

  - `  CUME_DIST()  `  
    Returns a double that indicates the cumulative distribution of a value in a group of values, calculated using the formula `  <number of rows preceding or tied with the current row> / <total rows>  ` . Tied values return the same cumulative distribution value.
    
    This window function requires `  ORDER BY  ` in the `  OVER  ` clause.

    </table>

  - `  DENSE_RANK()  `  
    Returns the integer rank of a value in a group of values. The rank is calculated based on comparisons with other values in the group.
    
    Tied values display as the same rank. The rank of the next value is incremented by 1. For example, if two values tie for rank 2, the next ranked value is 3. If you prefer a gap in the ranking list, use [rank()](#rank) .
    
    This window function requires `  ORDER BY  ` in the `  OVER  ` clause.

## Other functions

### Syntax

Other functions

[`  CASE WHEN ... THEN  `](#case_when)

Use CASE to choose among two or more alternate expressions in your query.

[`  CURRENT_USER()  `](#current_user)

Returns the email address of the user running the query.

[`  EVERY()  `](#every)

Returns true if the argument is true for all of its inputs.

[`  FROM_BASE64()  `](#from-base64)

Converts the base-64 encoded input string into BYTES format.

[`  HASH()  `](#hash)

Computes and returns a 64-bit signed hash value ...

[`  FARM_FINGERPRINT()  `](#farm_fingerprint)

Computes and returns a 64-bit signed fingerprint value ...

[`  IF()  `](#if)

If first argument is true, returns second argument; otherwise returns third argument.

[`  POSITION()  `](#position)

Returns the one-based, sequential position of the argument.

[`  SHA1()  `](#sha1)

Returns a [SHA1](https://www.w3.org/PICS/DSig/SHA1_1_0.html) hash, in BYTES format.

[`  SOME()  `](#some)

Returns true if argument is true for at least one of its inputs.

[`  TO_BASE64()  `](#to-base64)

Converts the BYTES argument to a base-64 encoded string.

  - `  CASE WHEN when_expr1 THEN then_expr1 WHEN when_expr2 THEN then_expr2 ... ELSE else_expr END  `  
    Use CASE to choose among two or more alternate expressions in your query. WHEN expressions must be boolean, and all the expressions in THEN clauses and ELSE clause must be compatible types.

  - `  CURRENT_USER()  `  
    Returns the email address of the user running the query.

  - `  EVERY( <condition> )  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if `  condition  ` is true for all of its inputs. When used with the `  OMIT IF  ` clause, this function is useful for queries that involve repeated fields.

  - `  FROM_BASE64( <str> )  `  
    Converts the base64-encoded input string `  str  ` into [BYTES](/bigquery/data-types#bytes-type) format. To convert BYTES to a base64-encoded string, use [TO\_BASE64()](#to-base64) .

  - `  HASH( expr )  `  
    Computes and returns a 64-bit signed hash value of the bytes of `  expr  ` as defined by the [CityHash](https://github.com/google/cityhash) library (version 1.0.3). Any string or integer expression is supported and the function respects `  IGNORE CASE  ` for strings, returning case invariant values.

  - `  FARM_FINGERPRINT( expr )  `  
    Computes and returns a 64-bit signed fingerprint value of the `  STRING  ` or `  BYTES  ` input using the `  Fingerprint64  ` function from the [open-source FarmHash library](https://github.com/google/farmhash) . The output of this function for a particular input will never change and matches the output of the [`  FARM_FINGERPRINT  `](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/hash_functions#farm_fingerprint) function when using [GoogleSQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/) . Respects `  IGNORE CASE  ` for strings, returning case invariant values.

  - `  IF( condition , true_return , false_return )  `  
    Returns either `  true_return  ` or `  false_return  ` , depending on whether `  condition  ` is true or false. The return values can be literals or field-derived values, but they must be the same data type. Field-derived values do not need to be included in the `  SELECT  ` clause.

  - `  POSITION( field )  `  
    Returns the one-based, sequential position of *field* within a set of repeated fields.

  - `  SHA1( <str> )  `  
    Returns a [SHA1](https://www.w3.org/PICS/DSig/SHA1_1_0.html) hash, in BYTES format, of the input string `  str  ` . You can convert the result to base64 using TO\_BASE64(). For example:
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      TO_BASE64(SHA1(corpus))
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.shakespeare]
    LIMIT
      100;
    ```

  - `  SOME( <condition> )  `  
    Returns `  true  ` if `  condition  ` is true for at least one of its inputs. When used with the `  OMIT IF  ` clause, this function is useful for queries that involve repeated fields.

  - `  TO_BASE64( <bin_data> )  `  
    Converts the [BYTES](/bigquery/data-types#bytes-type) input `  bin_data  ` to a base64-encoded string. For example:
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      TO_BASE64(SHA1(title))
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.wikipedia]
    LIMIT
      100;

  - **Bucketing results into categories using conditionals**
    
    The following query uses a `  CASE/WHEN  ` block to bucket results into "region" categories based on a list of states. If the state does not appear as an option in one of the `  WHEN  ` statements, the state value will default to "None."
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      CASE
        WHEN state IN ('WA', 'OR', 'CA', 'AK', 'HI', 'ID',
                       'MT', 'WY', 'NV', 'UT', 'CO', 'AZ', 'NM')
          THEN 'West'
        WHEN state IN ('OK', 'TX', 'AR', 'LA', 'TN', 'MS', 'AL',
                       'KY', 'GA', 'FL', 'SC', 'NC', 'VA', 'WV',
                       'MD', 'DC', 'DE')
          THEN 'South'
        WHEN state IN ('ND', 'SD', 'NE', 'KS', 'MN', 'IA',
                       'MO', 'WI', 'IL', 'IN', 'MI', 'OH')
          THEN 'Midwest'
        WHEN state IN ('NY', 'PA', 'NJ', 'CT',
                       'RI', 'MA', 'VT', 'NH', 'ME')
          THEN 'Northeast'
        ELSE 'None'
      END as region,
      average_mother_age,
      average_father_age,
      state, year
    FROM
      (SELECT
         year, state,
         SUM(mother_age)/COUNT(mother_age) as average_mother_age,
         SUM(father_age)/COUNT(father_age) as average_father_age
       FROM
         [bigquery-public-data:samples.natality]
       WHERE
         father_age < 99
       GROUP BY
         year, state)
    ORDER BY
      year
    LIMIT 5;
    ```
    
    **Returns:**
    
    ``` text
    +--------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+------+
    | region | average_mother_age | average_father_age | state | year |
    +--------+--------------------+--------------------+-------+------+

    <div id="pivottable">
    
    **Simulating a Pivot Table**
    
    Use conditional statements to organize the results of a subselect query into rows and columns. In the example below, results from a search for most revised Wikipedia articles that start with the value 'Google' are organized into columns where the revision counts are displayed if they meet various criteria.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      page_title,
      /* Populate these columns as True or False, */
      /*  depending on the condition */
      IF (page_title CONTAINS 'search',
          INTEGER(total), 0) AS search,
      IF (page_title CONTAINS 'Earth' OR
          page_title CONTAINS 'Maps', INTEGER(total), 0) AS geo,
    FROM
      /* Subselect to return top revised Wikipedia articles */
      /* containing 'Google', followed by additional text. */
      (SELECT
        TOP (title, 5) as page_title,
        COUNT (*) as total
       FROM
         [bigquery-public-data:samples.wikipedia]
       WHERE
         REGEXP_MATCH (title, r'^Google.+') AND wp_namespace = 0
      );
    ```
    
    **Returns:**
    
    ``` text
    +---------------+--------+------+
    |  page_title   | search | geo  |
    +---------------+--------+------+
    | Google search |   4261 |    0 |
    | Google Earth  |      0 | 3874 |
    | Google Chrome |      0 |    0 |
    | Google Maps   |      0 | 2617 |
    | Google bomb   |      0 |    0 |

    <div id="hash">
    
    **Using HASH to select a random sample of your data**
    
    Some queries can provide a useful result using random subsampling of the result set. To retrieve a random sampling of values, use the `  HASH  ` function to return results in which the modulo "n" of the hash equals zero.
    
    For example, the following query will find the `  HASH()  ` of the "title" value, and then checks if that value modulo "2" is zero. This should result in about 50% of the values being labeled as "sampled." To sample fewer values, increase the value of the modulo operation from "2" to something larger. The query uses the `  ABS  ` function in combination with `  HASH  ` , because `  HASH  ` can return negative values, and the [modulo operator](#arithmeticoperators) on a negative value yields a negative value.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT
      title,
      HASH(title) AS hash_value,
      IF(ABS(HASH(title)) % 2 == 1, 'True', 'False')
        AS included_in_sample
    FROM
      [bigquery-public-data:samples.wikipedia]
    WHERE
      wp_namespace = 0
    LIMIT 5;
    ```
    
    </div>
