# Data insights overview

This document provides an overview of data insights, a Gemini in BigQuery feature that helps accelerate initial exploration and analysis when facing new or unfamiliar data. Data insights automatically generates descriptions, relationship graphs, and SQL queries, along with suggested questions in natural language, from your table and dataset metadata. This information helps you quickly understand data structure, content, and relationships without extensive manual setup.

**Note:** To give feedback for this feature, contact <dataplex-data-insights-help@google.com> .

## Before you begin

Data insights are generated using [Gemini in BigQuery](/gemini/docs/bigquery/overview) . To start generating insights, you must first [set up Gemini in BigQuery](/gemini/docs/bigquery/set-up-gemini) .

**Note** : Gemini in BigQuery is part of Gemini for Google Cloud and doesn't support the same compliance and security offerings as BigQuery. You should only set up Gemini in BigQuery for BigQuery projects that don't require [compliance offerings that aren't supported by Gemini for Google Cloud](/gemini/docs/discover/certifications) . For information about how to turn off or prevent access to Gemini in BigQuery, see [Turn off Gemini in BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/gemini-set-up#turn-off) .

## Types of data insights

You can generate data insights at the table or dataset level:

  - **For tables:** Gemini generates natural language questions and their SQL equivalents to help you understand data within a single table. Through table insights, you can detect data patterns, anomalies, outliers, or quality issues within a table. Gemini also generates table and column descriptions.

  - **For datasets:** ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ) Gemini generates an interactive relationship graph showing cross-table relationships and cross-table SQL queries to help you understand how tables are related in a dataset. Through relationship graphs, you can discover how data is derived, which can help with quality, consistency, or redundancy issues. Through cross-table queries, you can find broader relationships. For example, you can calculate revenue by customer segment by leveraging data in a sales table and a customer table.

To investigate further, you can ask follow-up questions in [data canvas](/bigquery/docs/data-canvas) .

### Table insights

Table insights help you understand the content, quality, and patterns within a single BigQuery table. For example, by generating queries that perform statistical analysis, you can use table insights to detect data patterns, anomalies, and outliers. Table insights can also help you detect quality issues, especially when [data profile scans](/dataplex/docs/data-profiling-overview) are available for a table. When you generate insights for a table, Gemini provides table description, column descriptions, and profile scan output based on the table's metadata. The following options are available:

  - **Generate queries:** suggests natural language questions and provides the corresponding SQL queries to answer them. This helps you uncover patterns, assess data quality, and perform statistical analysis without writing SQL from scratch.
  - **Generate descriptions:** generates descriptions for the table and its columns. Gemini uses profile scan output (if available) to ground the generated descriptions. You can review, edit, and publish these descriptions to Dataplex Universal Catalog to improve data discoverability and documentation.

### Dataset insights

Dataset insights help you understand the relationships and join paths across multiple tables within a BigQuery dataset, which provides a holistic view of the dataset's contents. When you generate insights for a dataset, Gemini provides the following:

  - **Dataset description:** provides an AI-generated summary of the dataset.
  - **Relationships:** displays a visual, interactive map showing relationships between tables within the dataset. You can hover over connections to see relationship details, such as join keys.
  - **Relationship table:** presents a tabular view of relationships between tables, including foreign keys and inferred joins. Relationships can be schema-defined (from primary and foreign key constraints), usage-based (from query logs), or Gemini infers them based on table and column names and descriptions.
  - **Query recommendations:** offers sample SQL queries that demonstrate how to join data across different tables, based on the identified relationships.

## Example of table data insights

Consider a table called `  telco_churn  ` with columns such as `  CustomerID  ` , `  Tenure  ` , `  InternetService  ` , `  Contract  ` , `  MonthlyCharges  ` , and `  Churn  ` . The following table describes the table's metadata.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Field name</th>
<th>Type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       CustomerID      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       STRING      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       Gender      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       STRING      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       Tenure      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       INT64      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       InternetService      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       STRING      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       STRING      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       Contract      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       STRING      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       TechSupport      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       STRING      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       PaymentMethod      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       STRING      </code></td>

<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       FLOAT64      </code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       Churn      </code></td>
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       BOOL      </code></td>

Data insights generates the following sample queries for this table:

  - Identify customers who have subscribed to all premium services and have been customers for more than 50 months.
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      CustomerID,
      Contract,
      Tenure
    FROM
      agentville_datasets.telco_churn
    WHERE
      OnlineBackup = 'Yes'
      AND TechSupport = 'Yes'
      AND StreamingTV = 'Yes'
      AND Tenure > 50;
    ```

  - Identify which internet service has the most churned customers.
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      InternetService,
      COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS customers
    FROM
      agentville_datasets.telco_churn
    WHERE
      Churn = TRUE
    GROUP BY
      InternetService
    ORDER BY
      customers DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

## Example of dataset data insights

Consider a dataset containing `  order_items  ` and `  inventory_items  ` tables. Dataset insights can infer that `  order_items.inventory_item_id  ` relates to `  inventory_items.id  ` .

Based on these relationships, Gemini might generate the following cross-table query:

Identify the top 5 product categories with the highest average sale price and their corresponding average cost.

``` text
SELECT
  ii.product_category,
  AVG(oi.sale_price) AS avg_sale_price,
  AVG(ii.cost) AS avg_cost
FROM
  `ecommerce_data.order_items` AS oi
JOIN
  `ecommerce_data.inventory_items` AS ii
ON oi.inventory_item_id = ii.id
GROUP BY
  ii.product_category
ORDER BY
  avg_sale_price DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
