# Manage materialized view replicas

This document describes how to manage materialized view replicas in BigQuery.

BigQuery management of materialized view replicas includes the following operations:

  - [List materialized view replicas](#list)
  - [Get information about materialized view replicas](#get-info)
  - [Delete materialized view replicas](#delete)

For more information about materialized view replicas, see the following:

  - [Materialized view replicas](/bigquery/docs/load-data-using-cross-cloud-transfer#materialized_view_replicas)
  - [Create materialized view replicas](/bigquery/docs/load-data-using-cross-cloud-transfer#create)

## Before you begin

Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that give users the necessary permissions to perform each task in this document. The permissions required to perform a task (if any) are listed in the "Required permissions" section of the task.

## List materialized view replicas

You can list materialized view replicas through the Google Cloud console.

### Required permissions

To list materialized view replicas in a dataset, you need the `  bigquery.tables.list  ` IAM permission.

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need in order to list materialized view replicas in a dataset:

  - `  roles/bigquery.user  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.metadataViewer  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.dataViewer  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.dataOwner  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.admin  `

For more information on IAM roles and permissions in IAM, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

To list the materialized view replicas in a dataset:

1.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then click the dataset.

3.  Click **Overview \> Tables** . Scroll through the list to see the tables in the dataset. Tables, views, and materialized views are identified by different values in the **Type** column. Materialized view replicas have the same value as materialized views.

## Get information about materialized view replicas

You can get information about a materialized view replica by using SQL, the bq command-line tool, or the BigQuery API.

### Required permissions

To query information about a materialized view replica, you need the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions:

  - `  bigquery.tables.get  `
  - `  bigquery.tables.list  `
  - `  bigquery.routines.get  `
  - `  bigquery.routines.list  `

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the preceding permissions:

  - `  roles/bigquery.metadataViewer  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.dataViewer  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.admin  `

For more information about BigQuery permissions, see [Access control with IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

To get information about a materialized view replica, including the source [materialized view](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro) :

### SQL

To get information about materialized view replicas, query the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-tables) :

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT * FROM PROJECT_ID.DATASET_ID.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
    WHERE table_type = 'MATERIALIZED VIEW';
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the name of the project that contains the materialized view replicas
      - `  DATASET_ID  ` : the name of the dataset that contains the materialized view replicas

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### bq

Use the [`  bq show  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_show) :

``` text
bq show --project=project_id --format=prettyjson dataset.materialized_view_replica
```

Replace the following:

  - project\_id : the project ID. You only need to include this flag to get information about a materialized view replica in a different project than the default project.
  - dataset : the name of the dataset that contains the materialized view replica.
  - materialized\_view\_replica : the name of the materialized view replica that you want information about.

Example:

Enter the following command to show information about the materialized view replica `  my_mv_replica  ` in the `  report_views  ` dataset in the `  myproject  ` project.

``` text
bq show --project=myproject --format=prettyjson report_views.my_mv_replica
```

### API

To get materialized view replica information by using the API, call the [`  tables.get  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/get) method.

## Delete materialized view replicas

You can delete a materialized view replica through the Google Cloud console.

**Caution:** Deleting a materialized view replica can't be undone.

### Required permissions

To delete materialized view replicas, you need the `  bigquery.tables.delete  ` IAM permission.

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need in order to delete a materialized view replica:

  - `  bigquery.dataEditor  `
  - `  bigquery.dataOwner  `
  - `  bigquery.admin  `

For more information about BigQuery Identity and Access Management (IAM), see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

1.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

2.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then click the dataset.

3.  Click **Overview \> Tables** , and then click the materialized view replica.

4.  Click **Delete** .

5.  In the **Delete materialized view?** dialog, type `  delete  ` into the field, and then click **Delete** .
