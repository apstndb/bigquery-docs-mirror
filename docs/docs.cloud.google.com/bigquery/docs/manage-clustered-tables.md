# Manage clustered tables

This document describes how to get information about and control access to clustered tables in BigQuery.

For more information, see the following:

  - To learn about clustered table support in BigQuery, see [Introduction to clustered tables](/bigquery/docs/clustered-tables) .
  - To learn how to create clustered tables, see [Create clustered tables](/bigquery/docs/creating-clustered-tables) .

## Before you begin

To get information about tables, you must have the `  bigquery.tables.get  ` permission. The following predefined IAM roles include `  bigquery.tables.get  ` permissions:

  - `  roles/bigquery.metadataViewer  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.dataViewer  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.dataOwner  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.admin  `

In addition, if a user has the `  bigquery.datasets.create  ` permission, when that user creates a dataset, they are granted `  bigquery.dataOwner  ` access to it. `  bigquery.dataOwner  ` access gives the user the ability to get information about tables in a dataset.

For more information about IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

## Control access to clustered tables

To configure access to tables and views, you can grant an IAM role to an entity at the following levels, listed in order of range of resources allowed (largest to smallest):

  - a high level in the [Google Cloud resource hierarchy](/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy) such as the project, folder, or organization level
  - the dataset level
  - the table or view level

You can also restrict data access within tables, by using the following methods:

  - [column-level security](/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro)
  - [column data masking](/bigquery/docs/column-data-masking-intro)
  - [row-level security](/bigquery/docs/row-level-security-intro)

Access with any resource protected by IAM is additive. For example, if an entity does not have access at the high level such as a project, you could grant the entity access at the dataset level, and then the entity will have access to the tables and views in the dataset. Similarly, if the entity does not have access at the high level or the dataset level, you could grant the entity access at the table or view level.

Granting IAM roles at a higher level in the [Google Cloud resource hierarchy](/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy) such as the project, folder, or organization level gives the entity access to a broad set of resources. For example, granting a role to an entity at the project level gives that entity permissions that apply to all datasets throughout the project.

Granting a role at the dataset level specifies the operations an entity is allowed to perform on tables and views in that specific dataset, even if the entity does not have access at a higher level. For information on configuring dataset-level access controls, see [Controlling access to datasets](/bigquery/docs/dataset-access-controls) .

Granting a role at the table or view level specifies the operations an entity is allowed to perform on specific tables and views, even if the entity does not have access at a higher level. For information on configuring table-level access controls, see [Controlling access to tables and views](/bigquery/docs/table-access-controls) .

You can also create [IAM custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) . If you create a custom role, the permissions you grant depend on the specific operations you want the entity to be able to perform.

You can't set a "deny" permission on any resource protected by IAM.

For more information about roles and permissions, see [Understanding roles](/iam/docs/understanding-roles) in the IAM documentation and the BigQuery [IAM roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

## Get information about clustered tables

Select one of the following options:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Resources** pane.

2.  Click your dataset name to expand it, and then click the table name that you want to view.

3.  Click **Details** .
    
    The table's details are displayed, including the clustering columns.

### SQL

For clustered tables, you can query the `  CLUSTERING_ORDINAL_POSITION  ` column in the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-columns) to find the 1-indexed offset of the column within the table's clustering columns:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE TABLE mydataset.data (column1 INT64, column2 INT64)
    CLUSTER BY column1, column2;
    SELECT
      column_name, clustering_ordinal_position
    FROM
      mydataset.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS;
    ```

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

The clustering ordinal position is 1 for `  column1  ` and 2 for `  column2  ` . More table metadata is available through the `  TABLES  ` , `  TABLE_OPTIONS  ` , `  COLUMNS  ` , and `  COLUMN_FIELD_PATH  ` views in [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-intro) .

### bq

Issue the `  bq show  ` command to display all table information. Use the `  --schema  ` flag to display only table schema information. The `  --format  ` flag can be used to control the output.

If you are getting information about a table in a project other than your default project, add the project ID to the dataset in the following format: `  project_id:dataset  ` .

``` text
bq show \
    --schema \
    --format=prettyjson \
    PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your project ID
  - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the dataset
  - `  TABLE  ` : the name of the table

Examples:

Enter the following command to display all information about `  myclusteredtable  ` in `  mydataset  ` . `  mydataset  ` in your default project.

``` text
bq show --format=prettyjson mydataset.myclusteredtable
```

The output should look like the following:

``` console
{
  "clustering": {
    "fields": [
      "customer_id"
    ]
  },
...
}
```

### API

Call the [`  bigquery.tables.get  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/get) method and provide any relevant parameters.

## List clustered tables in a dataset

The permissions required to list clustered tables and the steps to list them are the same as for standard tables. For more information, see [Listing tables in a dataset](/bigquery/docs/tables#list_tables_in_a_dataset) .

## Modify the clustering specification

You can change or remove a table's clustering specifications, or change the set of clustered columns in a clustered table. This method of updating the clustering column set is useful for tables that use continuous streaming inserts because those tables cannot be easily swapped by other methods.

Follow these steps to apply a new clustering specification to unpartitioned or partitioned tables.

1.  In the bq tool, update the clustering specification of your table to match the new clustering:
    
    ``` text
     bq update --clustering_fields=CLUSTER_COLUMN DATASET.ORIGINAL_TABLE 
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  CLUSTER_COLUMN  ` : the column you are clustering on—for example, `  mycolumn  `
      - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the dataset containing the table—for example, `  mydataset  `
      - `  ORIGINAL_TABLE  ` : the name of your original table—for example, `  mytable  `
    
    You can also call the `  tables.update  ` or `  tables.patch  ` API method to [modify the clustering specification](/bigquery/docs/manage-clustered-tables#modifying-cluster-spec) .

2.  To cluster all rows according to the new clustering specification, run the following `  UPDATE  ` statement:
    
    ``` text
    UPDATE DATASET.ORIGINAL_TABLE SET CLUSTER_COLUMN=CLUSTER_COLUMN WHERE true
    ```
    
    **Note:** If a new clustering specification is applied to a table that is in long-term storage, then the table reverts to active storage pricing. For more information, see [Storage pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#storage) .
