This document shows you how to schedule and manage recurring load jobs for CSS Center reporting data using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service.

## Before you begin

Before you create a CSS Center data transfer:

  - [Enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store the CSS Center data.
      - For dataset region, we support using the default option, Multi-region, in either US or EU.
      - If you want to create a dataset in a specific region, the CSS Center data transfer is only supported in the following regions:
      - `  us-east4 (Northern Virginia)  ` ,
      - `  asia-northeast1 (Tokyo)  ` ,
      - `  asia-southeast1 (Singapore)  ` ,
      - `  australia-southeast1 (Sydney)  ` ,
      - `  europe-north1 (Findland)  ` ,
      - `  europe-west2 (London)  ` ,
      - `  europe-west6 (Zurich)  ` .
  - You must have your CSS domain ID in order to create a CSS Center data transfer.
  - If you intend to setup transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, you must have `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` permissions. Pub/Sub permissions are not required if you only set up email notifications. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service Run Notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

## Required permissions

Ensure that you have granted the following permissions.

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer:

  - BigQuery Data Transfer Service permissions:
      - `  bigquery.transfers.update  `
      - `  bigquery.transfers.get  `
  - BigQuery permissions:
      - `  bigquery.datasets.get  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.update  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information, see [Grant `  bigquery.admin  ` access](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service#grant_bigqueryadmin_access) .

### Required CSS Center roles

You must have access to the CSS Center account that is used in the transfer configuration.

## Set up a CSS Center transfer

To create a data transfer for CSS Center reporting:

### Console

1.  Go to the Data transfers page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  Click add **Create transfer** .

3.  On the **Create Transfer** page:
    
      - In the **Source type** section, for **Source** , choose **Google CSS Center** .
    
      - In the **Transfer config name** section, for **Display name** , enter a name for the data transfer such as `  My Transfer  ` . The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.
    
      - The **Schedule options** section is not configurable. CSS Center data transfers are scheduled to run once every 24 hours.
    
      - In the **Destination settings** section, for **Destination dataset** , choose the dataset that you created to store your data.
    
      - In the **Data source details** section, for **CSS ID** , enter your CSS domain ID.
    
      - Select the report(s) that you would like to transfer. See [Supported reports](/bigquery/docs/css-center-transfer#supported_reports) for more details.
    
      - (Optional) In the **Notification options** section:
        
          - Click the toggle to enable email notifications. When you enable this option, the transfer administrator receives an email notification when a transfer run fails.
          - For **Select a Pub/Sub topic** , choose your [topic](/pubsub/docs/overview#types) name or click **Create a topic** . This option configures Pub/Sub run [notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) for your data transfer.

4.  Click **Save** .

### bq

Enter the `  bq mk  ` command and supply the transfer creation flag — `  --transfer_config  ` . The following flags are also required:

  - `  --data_source  `
  - `  --target_dataset  `
  - `  --display_name  `
  - `  --params  `

You can also supply the `  --project_id  ` flag to specify a particular project. If `  --project_id  ` isn't specified, the default project is used.

``` text
bq mk \
--transfer_config \
--project_id=project_id \
--target_dataset=dataset \
--display_name=name \
--params='parameters' \
--data_source=data_source
```

Where:

  - project\_id is your project ID.
  - dataset is the target dataset for the data transfer configuration.
  - name is the display name for the data transfer configuration. The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.
  - parameters contains the parameters for the created data transfer configuration in JSON format. For example: `  --params='{"param":"param_value"}'  ` .
      - `  css_id  ` : the CSS domain ID.
      - `  export_products  ` : whether or not to transfer product and product issues data. This parameter is included by default, even if you don't specify the `  export_products  ` parameter. We recommend that you include this parameter explicitly and set it to `  true  ` .
  - data\_source is the data source — `  css_center  ` .

**Caution:** You cannot configure notifications by using the command-line tool.

For example, the following command creates a CSS Center data transfer named `  My Transfer  ` using CSS domain ID `  1234  ` and target dataset `  mydataset  ` . The data transfer is created in your default project.

``` text
bq mk \
--transfer_config \
--target_dataset=mydataset \
--display_name='My Transfer' \
--params='{"css_id":"1234","export_products":"true","export_regional_inventories":"true","export_local_inventories":"true","export_price_benchmarks":"true","export_best_sellers":"true"}' \
--data_source=css_center
```

The first time you run the command, you receive a message like the following:

`  [URL omitted] Please copy and paste the above URL into your web browser and follow the instructions to retrieve an authentication code.  `

Follow the instructions in the message and paste the authentication code on the command line.

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.transferConfigs.create  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create) method and supply an instance of the [`  TransferConfig  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs#TransferConfig) resource.
