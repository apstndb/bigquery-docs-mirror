This document shows how you can use the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool to extract the necessary metadata before running a Apache Hive data or permissions migration.

This document covers metadata extraction from the following data sources:

  - Apache Hive
  - Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
  - Apache Ranger
  - Cloudera Manager
  - Apache Hive query logs

## Before you begin

Before you can use the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool, do the following:

### Install Java

The server on which you plan to run `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool must have Java 8 or higher installed. If it doesn't, download Java from the [Java downloads page](https://www.java.com/download/) and install it.

### Required permissions

The user account that you specify for connecting the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool to the source system must have permissions to read metadata from that system. Confirm that this account has appropriate role membership to query the metadata resources available for your platform. For example, `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` is a metadata resource that is common across several platforms.

## Install the `     dwh-migration-dumper    ` tool

To install the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool, follow these steps:

1.  On the machine where you want to run the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool, download the zip file from the [`  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/dwh-migration-tools/releases/latest) .

2.  To validate the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool zip file, download the [`  SHA256SUMS.txt  ` file](https://github.com/google/dwh-migration-tools/releases/latest/download/SHA256SUMS.txt) and run the following command:
    
    ### Bash
    
    ``` text
    sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS.txt
    ```
    
    If verification fails, see [Troubleshooting](#corrupted_zip_file) .
    
    ### Windows PowerShell
    
    ``` text
    (Get-FileHash RELEASE_ZIP_FILENAME).Hash -eq ((Get-Content SHA256SUMS.txt) -Split " ")[0]
    ```
    
    Replace the `  RELEASE_ZIP_FILENAME  ` with the downloaded zip filename of the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` command-line extraction tool release—for example, `  dwh-migration-tools-v1.0.52.zip  `
    
    The `  True  ` result confirms successful checksum verification.
    
    The `  False  ` result indicates verification error. Make sure the checksum and zip files are downloaded from the same release version and placed in the same directory.

3.  Extract the zip file. The extraction tool binary is in the `  /bin  ` subdirectory of the folder created by extracting the zip file.

4.  Update the `  PATH  ` environment variable to include the installation path for the extraction tool.

## Extracting metadata for migration

Select one of the following options to learn how to extract metadata for your data source:

### Apache Hive

Perform the steps in the Apache Hive section [Extract metadata and query logs from your data warehouse](/bigquery/docs/migration-assessment#apache-hive) to extract your Apache Hive metadata. You can then upload the metadata to your Cloud Storage bucket containing your migration files.

### HDFS

Run the following command to extract extract metadata from HDFS using the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool.

``` text
dwh-migration-dumper \
  --connector hdfs \
  --host HDFS-HOST \
  --port HDFS-PORT \
  --output gs://MIGRATION-BUCKET/hdfs-dumper-output.zip \
  --assessment \
```

Replace the following:

  - `  HDFS-HOST  ` : the HDFS NameNode hostname
  - `  HDFS-PORT  ` : the HDFS NameNode port number. You can skip this argument if you are using the default `  8020  ` port.
  - `  MIGRATION-BUCKET  ` : the Cloud Storage bucket that you are using to store the migration files.

This command extracts metadata from HDFS to a file named `  hdfs-dumper-output.zip  ` in the `  MIGRATION-BUCKET  ` directory.

There are several known limitations when extracting metadata from HDFS:

  - Some tasks in this connector are optional and can fail, logging a full stack trade in the output. As long as the required tasks have succeeded and the `  hdfs-dumper-output.zip  ` is generated, then you can proceed with the HDFS migration.
  - The extraction process might fail or run slower than expected if the configured thread pool size is too large. If you are encountering these issues, we recommend decreasing the thread pool size using the command line argument `  --thread-pool-size  ` .

### Apache Ranger

Run the following command to extract extract metadata from Apache Ranger using the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool.

``` text
dwh-migration-dumper \
  --connector ranger \
  --host RANGER-HOST \
  --port 6080 \
  --user RANGER-USER \
  --password RANGER-PASSWORD \
  --ranger-scheme RANGER-SCHEME \
  --output gs://MIGRATION-BUCKET/ranger-dumper-output.zip \
  --assessment \
```

Replace the following:

  - `  RANGER-HOST  ` : the hostname of the Apache Ranger instance
  - `  RANGER-USER  ` : the username of the Apache Ranger user
  - `  RANGER-PASSWORD  ` : the password of the Apache Ranger user
  - `  RANGER-SCHEME  ` : specify if Apache Ranger is using `  http  ` or `  https  ` . Default value is `  http  ` .
  - `  MIGRATION-BUCKET  ` : the Cloud Storage bucket that you are using to store the migration files.

You can also include the following optional flags:

  - `  --kerberos-auth-for-hadoop  ` : replaces `  --user  ` and `  --password  ` , if Apache Ranger is protected by kerberos instead of basic authentication. You must run the `  kinit  ` command before the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool tool to use this flag.
  - `  --ranger-disable-tls-validation  ` : include this flag if the https certificate used by the API is self signed. For example, when using Cloudera.

This command extracts metadata from Apache Ranger to a file named `  ranger-dumper-output.zip  ` in the `  MIGRATION-BUCKET  ` directory.

### Cloudera

Run the following command to extract metadata from Cloudera using the `  dwh-migration-dumper  ` tool.

``` text
dwh-migration-dumper \
  --connector cloudera-manager \
  --url CLOUDERA-URL \
  --user CLOUDERA-USER \
  --password CLOUDERA-PASSWORD \
  --output gs://MIGRATION-BUCKET/cloudera-dumper-output.zip \
  --yarn-application-types APPLICATION-TYPES \
  --pagination-page-size PAGE-SIZE \
  --assessment \
```

Replace the following:

  - `  CLOUDERA-URL  ` : the URL for Cloudera Manager
  - `  CLOUDERA-USER  ` : the username of the Cloudera user
  - `  CLOUDERA-PASSWORD  ` : the password of the Cloudera user
  - `  MIGRATION-BUCKET  ` : the Cloud Storage bucket that you are using to store the migration files.
  - `  APPLICATION-TYPES  ` : (Optional) list of all existing application types from Hadoop YARN. For example, `  SPARK, MAPREDUCE  ` .
  - `  PAGE-SIZE  ` : (Optional) specify how much data is fetched from 3rd party services, like the Hadoop YARN API. The default value is `  1000  ` , which represents 1000 entities per request.

This command extracts metadata from Cloudera to a file named `  dwh-migration-cloudera.zip  ` in the `  MIGRATION-BUCKET  ` directory.

### Apache Hive query logs

Perform the steps in the Apache Hive section [Extract query logs with the `  hadoop-migration-assessment  ` logging hook](/bigquery/docs/migration-assessment#apache-hive) to extract your Apache Hive query logs. You can then upload the logs to your Cloud Storage bucket containing your migration files.

## What's next

With your extracted metadata from Hadoop, you can use these metadata files to do the following:

  - [Migrate permissions from Hadoop](/bigquery/docs/hadoop-permissions-migration)
  - [Schedule a Hadoop transfer](/bigquery/docs/hadoop-transfer)
