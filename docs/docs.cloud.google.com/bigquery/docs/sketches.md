GoogleSQL for BigQuery supports data sketches. A data sketch is a compact summary of a data aggregation. It captures all the necessary information to either extract an aggregation result, continue a data aggregation, or merge it with another sketch, enabling re-aggregation.

Computing a metric using a sketch is substantially less expensive than computing an exact value. If your computation is too slow or requires too much temporary storage, use sketches to reduce query time and resources.

Additionally, computing [cardinalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) , such as the number of distinct users, or [quantiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile) , such as median visit duration, without sketches is usually only possible by running jobs over the raw data because already-aggregated data can't be combined anymore.

Consider a table with the following data:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Product</th>
<th>Number of users</th>
<th>Median visit duration</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Product A</td>
<td>500 million</td>
<td>10 minutes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Product B</td>
<td>20 million</td>
<td>2 minutes</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Computing the total number of users for both products isn't possible because we don't know how many users used both products in the table. Likewise, computing the median visit duration isn't possible because the distribution of the visit durations has been lost.

A solution is to store sketches in the table instead. Each sketch is an approximate and compact representation of a particular input property, such as cardinality, that you can store, merge (or re-aggregate), and query for near-exact results. In the previous example, you can estimate the number of distinct users for Product A and Product B by creating and merging (re-aggregating) the sketches for each product. You can also estimate the median visit duration with quantile sketches that you can likewise merge and query.

For example, the following query uses [HLL++](#sketches_hll) and [KLL](#sketches_kll) sketches to estimate distinct users and median visit duration for YouTube (Product A) and Google Maps (Product B):

``` text
-- Build sketches for YouTube stats.
CREATE TABLE user.YOUTUBE_ACCESS_STATS
AS
SELECT
  HLL_COUNT.INIT(user_id) AS distinct_users_sketch,
  KLL_QUANTILES.INIT_INT64(visit_duration_ms) AS visit_duration_ms_sketch,
  hour_of_day
FROM YOUTUBE_ACCESS_LOG()
GROUP BY hour_of_day;

-- Build sketches for Maps stats.
CREATE TABLE user.MAPS_ACCESS_STATS
AS
SELECT
  HLL_COUNT.INIT(user_id) AS distinct_users_sketch,
  KLL_QUANTILES.INIT_INT64(visit_duration_ms) AS visit_duration_ms_sketch,
  hour_of_day
FROM MAPS_ACCESS_LOG()
GROUP BY hour_of_day;

-- Query YouTube hourly stats.
SELECT
  HLL_COUNT.EXTRACT(distinct_users_sketch) AS distinct_users,
  KLL_QUANTILES.EXTRACT_POINT_INT64(visit_duration_ms_sketch, 0.5)
  AS median_visit_duration, hour_of_day
FROM user.YOUTUBE_ACCESS_STATS;

-- Query YouTube daily stats.
SELECT
  HLL_COUNT.MERGE(distinct_users_sketch),
  KLL_QUANTILES.MERGE_POINT_INT64(visit_duration_ms_sketch, 0.5)
  AS median_visit_duration, date
FROM user.YOUTUBE_ACCESS_STATS
GROUP BY date;

-- Query total stats across YouTube and Maps.
SELECT
  HLL_COUNT.MERGE(distinct_users_sketch) AS unique_users_all_services,
  KLL_QUANTILES.MERGE_POINT_INT64(visit_duration_ms_sketch, 0.5)
    AS median_visit_duration_all_services,
FROM
  (
    SELECT * FROM user.YOUTUBE_ACCESS_STATS
    UNION ALL
    SELECT * FROM user.MAPS_ACCESS_STATS
  );
```

Because a sketch has lossy compression of the original data, it introduces a statistical error that's represented by an error bound or confidence interval (CI). For most applications, this uncertainty is small. For example, a typical cardinality-counting sketch has a relative error of about 1% in 95% of all cases. A sketch trades some accuracy, or *precision* , for faster and less expensive computations, and less storage.

In summary, a sketch has these main properties:

  - Represents an approximate aggregate for a specific metric
  - Is compact
  - Is a serialized form of an in-memory, sublinear data structure
  - Is typically a fixed size and asymptotically smaller than the input
  - Can introduce a statistical error that you determine with a precision level
  - Can be merged with other sketches to summarize the union of the underlying data sets

## Re-aggregation with sketch merging

Sketches let you store and merge data for efficient re-aggregation. This makes sketches particularly useful for materialized views of data sets. You can merge sketches to construct a summary of multiple data streams based on partial sketches created for each stream.

For example, if you create a sketch for the estimated number of distinct users every day, you can get the number of distinct users during the last seven days by merging daily sketches. Re-aggregating the merged daily sketches helps you avoid reading the full input of the data set.

Sketch re-aggregation is also useful in online analytical processing (OLAP). You can merge sketches to create a roll-up of an [OLAP cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP_cube) , where the sketch summarizes data along one or more specific dimensions of the cube. OLAP roll-ups aren't possible with true distinct counts.

## Which type of sketch should I use?

Different sketching algorithms are designed for different types of metrics, such as [HLL++](#sketches_hll) for distinct counts and [KLL](#sketches_kll) for quantiles. GoogleSQL also provides [Approximate aggregate functions](#approx_functions) that you can use to query these types of data without having to specify query details such as precision level.

The sketch that you use depends on the type of data that you need to estimate.

### Estimate cardinality

If you need to estimate [cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) , use an [HLL++ sketch](#sketches_hll) .

For example, to get the number of unique users who actively used a product in a given month (MAU or 28DAU metrics), use an HLL++ sketch.

### Compute a quantile

If you need to get a [quantile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile) of a data set, use a [KLL sketch](#sketches_kll) .

For example, to get the median visit duration of customers in a store, or to track the 95th percentile latency that tickets stay in a queue before being addressed, use a KLL sketch.

## HLL++ sketches

HyperLogLog++ (HLL++) is a sketching algorithm for estimating cardinality. HLL++ is based on the paper [HyperLogLog in Practice](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/40671.pdf) , where the *++* denotes the augmentations made to the HyperLogLog algorithm.

[Cardinality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) is the number of distinct elements in the input for a sketch. For example, you could use an HLL++ sketch to get the number of unique users who have opened an application.

HLL++ estimates very small and very large cardinalities. HLL++ includes a 64-bit hash function, sparse representation to reduce memory requirements for small cardinality estimates, and empirical bias correction for small cardinality estimates.

**Precision**

HLL++ sketches support custom precision. The following table shows the supported precision values, the maximum storage size, and the confidence interval (CI) of typical precision levels:

You can define precision for an HLL++ sketch when you initialize it with the [`  HLL_COUNT.INIT  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/hll_functions#hll_countinit) function.

**Deletion**

You can't delete values from an HLL++ sketch.

**Additional details**

For a list of functions that you can use with HLL++ sketches, see [HLL++ functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/hll_functions) .

### Sketch integration

You can integrate HLL++ sketches with other systems. For example, you can build sketches in external applications, like [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow) , [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) , and [ZetaSketch](https://github.com/google/zetasketch) and then consume them in GoogleSQL or vice versa.

In addition to GoogleSQL, you can use HLL++ sketches with [Java](https://github.com/google/zetasketch/blob/master/java/com/google/zetasketch/HyperLogLogPlusPlus.java) .

## KLL sketches

KLL (short for Karnin-Lang-Liberty) is a streaming algorithm to compute sketches for approximate [quantiles](#quantiles) . It computes arbitrary quantiles far more efficiently than exact computations at the price of a small approximation error.

**Precision**

KLL sketches support custom precision. Precision defines the exactness of a returned approximate quantile *q* .

By default, the rank of an approximate quantile can be at most `  ±1/1000 * n  ` off from `  ⌈Φ * n⌉  ` , where `  n  ` is the number of rows in the input and `  ⌈Φ * n⌉  ` is the rank of the exact quantile.

If you provide custom precision, the rank of the approximate quantile can be at most `  ±1/precision * n  ` off from the rank of the exact quantile. The error is within this error bound in 99.999% of cases. This error guarantee only applies to the difference between exact and approximate ranks. The numerical difference between the exact and approximated value for a quantile can be arbitrarily large.

For example, suppose you want to find the median value, `  Φ = 0.5  ` , and you use the default precision of `  1000  ` . Then the rank of the value returned by the `  KLL_QUANTILES.EXTRACT_POINT  ` function differs from the true rank by at most `  n/1000  ` in 99.999% of cases. In other words, the returned value is almost always between the 49.9th and 50.1st percentiles. If you have 1,000,000 items in your sketch, then the rank of the returned median is almost always between 499,000 and 501,000.

If you use a custom precision of `  100  ` to find the median value, then the rank of the value returned by the `  KLL_QUANTILES.EXTRACT_POINT  ` function differs from the true rank by at most `  n/100  ` in 99.999% of cases. In other words, the returned value is almost always between the 49th and 51st percentiles. If you have 1,000,000 items in your sketch, then the rank of the returned median is almost always between 490,000 and 510,000.

You can define precision for a KLL sketch when you initialize it with the [`  KLL_QUANTILES.INIT  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/kll_functions#kll_quantilesinit_int64) function.

**Size**

KLL sketch size depends on the precision parameter and the input type. If your input type is `  INT64  ` , the sketches can use additional optimization that's especially helpful if the input values come from a small universe. The following table contains two columns for `  INT64  ` . One column provides an upper bound on sketch size for items from a limited universe of size 1B, and a second column provides an upper bound for arbitrary input values.

**Phi**

Phi (Φ) represents the quantile to produce as a fraction of the total number of rows in sketch input, normalized between 0 and 1. If a function supports phi, the function returns a value *v* such that approximately Φ \* *n* inputs are less than or equal to *v* , and (1-Φ) \* *n* inputs are greater than or equal to *v* .

**Additional details**

For a list of functions that you can use with KLL sketches, see [KLL quantile functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/kll_functions#kll_functions) .

The KLL algorithm is defined in the paper [Optimal Quantile Approximation in Streams](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.05346v2.pdf) , and is named after its authors, Karnin, Lang, and Liberty, who published the paper in 2016. The KLL algorithm improves the older [MP80 algorithm](https://polylogblog.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/80munro-median.pdf) by using variable-size buffers to reduce memory use for large data sets, reducing the sketch size from `  O(log n)  ` to `  O(1)  ` . Due to the non-deterministic nature of the algorithm, sketches created on the same set of data with the same precision might not be identical.

## Quantiles

[Quantiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile) are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way. A quantile-supporting sketch lets you estimate quantiles by summarizing those intervals and probabilities into near-exact quantile results.

Quantiles are typically defined in two ways:

  - For a positive integer `  q  ` , `  q  ` -quantiles are a set of values that partition an input set into `  q  ` subsets of nearly equal size. Some of these have specific names: the single 2-quantile is the median, the 4-quantiles are quartiles, the 100-quantiles are percentiles, etc. KLL functions additionally return the (exact) minimum and the maximum of the input, so when querying for the 2-quantiles, three values are returned.
    
    **Tip:** To extract a set of `  q  ` -quantiles where `  q  ` is the `  number  ` argument, use the `  MERGE  ` and `  EXTRACT  ` functions in the `  KLL_QUANTILES.*  ` functions.

  - Alternatively, quantiles might be considered individual `  Φ  ` -quantiles, where `  Φ  ` is a real number with `  0 <= Φ <= 1  ` . The `  Φ  ` -quantile `  x  ` is an element of the input such that a `  Φ  ` fraction of the input is less than or equal to `  x  ` , and a `  (1-Φ)  ` fraction is greater than or equal to `  x  ` . In this notation, the median is the 0.5-quantile, and the 95th percentile is the 0.95-quantile.
    
    **Tip:** To extract individual `  Φ  ` -quantiles, use the quantile-supporting `  MERGE_POINT  ` and `  EXTRACT_POINT  ` functions, where `  Φ  ` is the `  phi  ` argument.

For example, you can use a quantiles-supporting sketch to get the median of the number of times an application is opened by users.

## Approximate aggregate functions

As an alternative to specific sketch-based approximation functions, GoogleSQL provides predefined approximate aggregate functions. These approximate aggregate functions support sketches for common estimations such as distinct count, quantiles, and top count, but they don't allow custom precision. They also don't expose and store the sketch for re-aggregation like other types of sketches. The approximate aggregate functions are designed for running quick sketch-based queries without detailed configuration.

For a list of approximate aggregate functions that you can use with sketch-based approximation, see [Approximate aggregate functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/approximate_aggregate_functions) .
