# Create an ML model in BigQuery ML by using the Google Cloud console

This document shows you how to use the Google Cloud console to create a BigQuery ML model.

## Required roles

  - To create a model and run inference, you must be granted the following roles:
    
      - BigQuery Data Editor ( `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` )
      - BigQuery User ( `  roles/bigquery.user  ` )

## Before you begin

1.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
    
    **Roles required to select or create a project**
    
      - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
      - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

2.  [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

3.  Enable the BigQuery and BigQuery Connection APIs.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

## Model-specific prerequisites

Before you create a model, make sure that you have addressed any prerequisites for the type of model that you are creating:

  - If you want to use a query to select training data for a model, you must have that query available as a [saved query](/bigquery/docs/saved-queries-introduction) .

  - Matrix factorization models require reservations. For more information, see [Pricing](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-matrix-factorization#pricing) .

  - The following remote models require a [Cloud resource connection](/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection) :
    
      - [Remote models over Vertex AI and partner models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model)
      - [Remote models over open models](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model-open)
      - [Remote models over Cloud AI services](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model-service)
      - [Remote models over custom models in Vertex AI](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create-remote-model-https)
    
    The connection's service account must also be granted certain roles, depending on the type of remote model.

  - To import a model, you must have that model uploaded to a Cloud Storage bucket.

## Create a dataset

Create a BigQuery dataset to contain your resources:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, click your project name.

4.  Click more\_vert **View actions \> Create dataset** .

5.  On the **Create dataset** page, do the following:
    
    1.  For **Dataset ID** , type a name for the dataset.
    
    2.  For **Location type** , select **Region** or **Multi-region** .
        
          - If you selected **Region** , then select a location from the **Region** list.
          - If you selected **Multi-region** , then select **US** or **Europe** from the **Multi-region** list.
    
    3.  Click **Create dataset** .

### bq

1.  To create a new dataset, use the [`  bq mk  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#mk-dataset) command with the `  --location  ` flag:
    
    ``` text
    bq --location=LOCATION mk -d DATASET_ID
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  LOCATION  ` : the dataset's [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) .
      - `  DATASET_ID  ` is the ID of the dataset that you're creating.

2.  Confirm that the dataset was created:
    
    ``` text
    bq ls
    ```
