# Use administrative jobs explorer

As a BigQuery administrator, you can use the administrative jobs explorer to help you monitor jobs activity across your organization. Jobs explorer also provides an array of filters and sorting options to troubleshoot and identify problematic jobs. Jobs explorer removes the need for you to have a deep understanding of `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` , and lets you quickly view job information such as owner, project, slot usage, duration, and more, without the need to write `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` queries.

You can also select individual jobs to open the [job details page](#get-job-details) , which provides query details such as execution graphs, SQL text, and execution history to help you diagnose and troubleshoot queries. From this page, you can [compare two jobs](#compare-jobs) to highlight significant differences between them and address potential performance issues.

BigQuery provides job details and insights through the following `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` views:

  - [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs)
  - [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_ORGANIZATION  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs-by-organization)
  - [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_USER  `](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs-by-user)

**Note:** If you use organization restrictions, see [Enable access to Google-owned resources](/resource-manager/docs/organization-restrictions/additional-considerations#google-owned-resources) .

## Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to use administrative jobs explorer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Resource Viewer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.resourceViewer) ( `  roles/bigquery.resourceViewer  ` ) IAM role on your organization or project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to use administrative jobs explorer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to use administrative jobs explorer:

  - To see data at project level: `  bigquery.jobs.listAll  ` on the project
  - To see data at organization level: `  bigquery.jobs.listAll  ` on the organization
  - To filter by reservations in your organization: `  bigquery.reservations.list  ` on the organization

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

**Note:** This organization view is only available if you have defined Google Cloud organizations.

## Filter jobs

To filter jobs for queries that are contained in the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS*  ` views, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Jobs explorer** .

3.  From the **Location** list, select the location for which you want to view the jobs.

4.  Apply optional **Filters** as needed:
    
      - **Job scope** . Such as the current project, organization, and your jobs.
      - **Status** . Such as completed, error, active, and queued.
      - **Job priority** . Such as interactive or batch jobs.
      - **Job ID** .
      - **Owner** . Email ID of the job's owner (only applicable when job scope is project or organization).
      - **Project ID** . (Only applicable when job scope is organization)
      - **Reservation ID** . (Only applicable when job scope is organization)
      - **Slot time more than** . Jobs that took more time than the specified slot time.

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

### View job details

To view the job details page, do the following:

1.  Go to the **Jobs Explorer** page.

2.  Optional: [filter](/bigquery/docs/admin-jobs-explorer#filter-jobs) the jobs to narrow the available jobs displayed.

3.  Click the job ID of the job you want to view. For queries that don't create a job, the query ID appears and the link is disabled. For all other queries, clicking the job ID displays the **Job details** page.

The **Performance** tab is displayed by default. You can navigate to the other tabs to view additional job information.

### Available query information

The following list describes the information and metrics available on the **Performance** tab.

  - **SQL Query** : the text of the SQL query that created the job.

  - **Job details** : the information about the job, including the job ID, creation time, bytes processed, and more. For more information, see [View job details](/bigquery/docs/managing-jobs#view-job) .

  - **Performance variance** : information about how the job performed in comparison to a past execution of the same query. BigQuery compares the current job to a past execution with similar bytes processed (+/- 5%) and the shortest job duration, if one exists. If no such past execution exists, then BigQuery compares the current job to the average of past executions in the last 30 days. If there are no past executions, then this section indicates that no similar job was found for comparison.

  - **Execution history** : a list of other executions of this query by query hash. From this panel, you can select a job to compare to the job you are viewing. For more information about comparing jobs, see [Compare jobs](#compare-jobs) .

  - **System load during execution** : a description of the resources BigQuery used to execute the job. This includes information about the reservation settings used by this job, if applicable.

  - **Execution graph** : the execution graph of this job. For more information, see [Get query performance insights](/bigquery/docs/query-insights) .

The job performance comparison lets you compare your baseline job to targeted jobs, and the query analysis highlights job details that differ significantly between the two jobs. This helps you troubleshoot potential performance issues between two query jobs.

Important details to consider for optimizing your queries when comparing two queries include job duration, slot time, and bytes processed.

### Before you begin

To get the permissions that you need to work with BigQuery job details and system-level details, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your organization or project:

  - View job details: BigQuery Resource Viewer ( `  roles/bigquery.resourceViewer  ` ) - the project where the queries were run
  - View system-level details: BigQuery Resource Viewer ( `  roles/bigquery.resourceViewer  ` ) - the administration project

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to work with BigQuery job details and system-level details. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to work with BigQuery job details and system-level details:

  - To see data at project level: `  bigquery.jobs.listAll  ` on the project
  - To see data at organization level: `  bigquery.jobs.listAll  ` on the organization
  - To filter by reservations in your organization: `  bigquery.reservations.list  ` on the organization

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

### Understand job performance comparison

The following sections describe the **Job performance comparison** page and the troubleshooting information it provides.

You can turn on the **Show only significant differences** toggle to view only significant differences between the two jobs for all metrics included on this page.

Significant differences are highlighted in green, yellow, and red:

  - **Green** : The change moves in a positive direction. For example, because shorter query duration is better, if the target job runs faster than the baseline job, it is marked as green.
  - **Yellow** : The change moves in a negative direction, but the difference is less than 20%.
  - **Red** : The change moves in a negative direction, and the difference is larger than 20%.

#### Query level analysis

The **Query level analysis** pane describes the differences between the two jobs at the query level. It contains three tabs: the **Metrics** , **SQL text** , and **Execution graph** tabs.

  - The **Metrics** tab describes the query metrics for the two jobs. Use this tab to determine if discrepancies exist between job duration, unused accelerators, and other metrics.

  - The **SQL text** tab shows the two SQL statements that created the jobs and highlights differences between them. Use this tab to determine whether changes in the SQL statements affected job performance.

  - The **Execution graph** tab compares the [execution graphs](/bigquery/docs/query-plan-explanation) of the two jobs. Use this tab to determine whether discrepancies occurred at any stage during the execution of the jobs.

#### System level analysis

The **System level analysis** pane describes the factors potentially affecting the two jobs at the system level. It consists of three sections: the **Project** table, the **Reservation** table, and the **Settings** table.

The **System level analysis** pane can suggest areas for improvement based on the differences between the two queries.

For example, if a job received fewer slots than previous executions, it might be impacted by resource constraints in the system. If this is indicated, check the project level metrics to see if the project as a whole received fewer slots. If the project did not receive fewer slots, then contention likely occurred at the project level, such as an increase in job concurrency. If the project did receive fewer slots, then check the reservation level to identify any constraints.

  - The **Project** table compares the two jobs at the project level. Use this table to determine if any optimization is possible at the project level.

  - The **Reservation** table compares the two jobs at the [reservation](/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro) level. Use this table to identify differences in reservation usage between the two queries that could affect job performance.

  - The **Settings** table compares the reservation settings between the two jobs. Use this table to detect any changes to reservation settings that could have caused a performance impact.

### Compare two jobs

To compare two jobs:

1.  Go to the **Jobs Explorer** page.

2.  Optional: [filter](/bigquery/docs/admin-jobs-explorer#filter-jobs) the jobs to narrow the available jobs displayed.
