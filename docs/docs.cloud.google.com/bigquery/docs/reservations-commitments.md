# Manage workload commitments

The BigQuery Reservation API lets you purchase dedicated slots (called [*commitments*](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) ), create pools of slots (called [*reservations*](/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro#reservations) ), and assign projects, folders, and organizations to those reservations.

A *capacity commitment* is a purchase of BigQuery compute capacity for some minimum duration of time. Purchasing a capacity commitment is optional when creating a reservation with an [edition](/bigquery/docs/editions-intro) , but can provide cost savings.

Commitments are a regional resource. Commitments purchased in one region or multi-region cannot be used in any other regions or multi-regions. Commitments cannot be moved between regions or between regions and multi-regions. Commitments cannot be moved between projects.

## Enable the Reservations API

The BigQuery Reservation API is distinct from the existing BigQuery API and must be enabled independently. For more information, see [Enabling and disabling APIs](/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis) .

  - The name of the API is "BigQuery Reservations API"
  - The endpoint for the BigQuery Reservation API is `  bigqueryreservation.googleapis.com  ` .

**Note:** If you want to prevent anyone in your organization from enabling the BigQuery Reservation API, [contact support](/bigquery/docs/getting-support) .

## Purchase commitments

To reserve capacity for some minimum amount of time, you can purchase a [capacity commitment](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) . This provides a discount and saves on costs. For more information about the specific costs, see [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#capacity_compute_analysis_pricing) .

### Required permissions

To create a capacity commitment, you need the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission:

  - `  bigquery.capacityCommitments.create  ` on the [administration project](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#admin-project) that maintains ownership of the commitments.

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes this permission:

  - `  BigQuery Admin  `
  - `  BigQuery Resource Admin  `

For more information about IAM roles in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

### Create a capacity commitment

**Caution:** Before creating a capacity commitment, understand the details of the [commitment plans](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) and [pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#capacity_compute_analysis_pricing) .

Commitments are a regional resource. Commitments purchased in one region or multi-region cannot be used in any other regions or multi-regions. Commitments cannot be moved between regions or between regions and multi-regions. Commitments cannot be moved between projects.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Capacity management** .

3.  Click **Create Commitment** .

4.  Under **Configure** :
    
    1.  Select the location.
    
    2.  In the **Capacity model** section, select the capacity model.
    
    3.  If you select the Autoscaling (Edition) option:
        
        1.  In the **Edition** list, select the edition. Capacity commitments are only supported in the Enterprise and Enterprise Plus editions.
    
    4.  Select the **Commitment duration** , which specifies your [commitment plan](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) .
    
    5.  If you are purchasing an **Annual** commitment, select the **Renewal plan that you want to take effect when the commitment expires** :
        
        1.  **Renew annually** . When the annual commitment expires, it renews for another year as an annual commitment.
        
        For more information, see [Slot commitments](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) .
    
    6.  Enter the **Number of slots** you want to purchase.
    
    7.  Click **Next** .

5.  Review the **Cost** estimate for your purchase.

6.  Under **Confirm and submit** :
    
    1.  Type CONFIRM to confirm the purchase.
    2.  Click **Purchase** to purchase the slots.

7.  To view the commitment, click **View slot commitments** . After the capacity is provisioned, the requested capacity commitment has a green status.
    
    **Note:** Slots are usually provisioned quickly, but in rare cases it can take several hours. If you have a critical workload where you expect to have increased demand, reserve your slots at least one day in advance.

The first time you purchase capacity, a `  default  ` reservation is created.

### SQL

To create a capacity commitment, use the [`  CREATE CAPACITY  ` DDL statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_capacity_statement) .

## Update capacity commitments

You can make the following updates to a capacity commitment:

  - Update the renewal plan of the commitment
  - Convert a commitment to a commitment plan with a longer duration.
  - Split a commitment into two commitments.
  - Merge two commitments into a single commitment.

### Required permissions

To update capacity commitments, you need the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission:

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes this permission:

  - `  BigQuery Admin  `
  - `  BigQuery Resource Admin  `

For more information about IAM roles in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

### Renew a commitment

Annual commitments have a renewal plan, which you specify when you create or convert to an annual commitment. You can change your [annual commitment's renewal plan](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#renew-commitments) at any time before the commitment end date.

### Console

You can change your renewal plan for an annual commitment as follows:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Capacity management** .

3.  Click the **Slot commitments** tab.

4.  Find the commitment you want to edit.

5.  Click more\_vert **Actions** , and then select the **Edit renewal plan** option.

6.  Select the new renewal plan.

### bq

To change the renewal plan choice for an annual commitment, use the [`  bq update  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_update) with the [`  --capacity_commitment  ` flag](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#update-capacity-commitment-flag) and the [`  --renewal_plan  ` flag](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#renewal_plan_flag) .

``` text
bq update \
    --project_id=ADMIN_PROJECT_ID \
    --location=LOCATION \
    --renewal_plan=PLAN_TYPE \
    --capacity_commitment=true \
    COMMITMENT_ID
```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the [administration project](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#admin-project) that will maintain ownership this commitment

  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the commitment

  - `  PLAN_TYPE  ` : the [plan type](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) , such as `  ANNUAL  ` or `  THREE_YEAR  ` .

  - `  COMMITMENT_ID  ` : the ID of the commitment
    
    To get the ID, see [View purchased commitments](#view-commitments) .

### Convert a commitment to longer duration

You can choose to convert your commitment to a longer-duration commitment type at any time. This works even if you want to convert from a legacy plan to an edition.

As soon as you update your commitment, you are charged the rate associated with the new plan, and the end date resets.

To convert a commitment, use the [`  bq update  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_update) with the [`  --plan  ` flag](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#update-plan-flag) .

``` text
bq update \
    --project_id=ADMIN_PROJECT_ID \
    --location=LOCATION \
    --plan=PLAN_TYPE \
    --renewal_plan=RENEWAL_PLAN \
    --capacity_commitment=true \
    COMMITMENT_ID
```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID

  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the commitment

  - `  PLAN_TYPE  ` : the [plan type](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) , such as `  ANNUAL  ` or `  THREE_YEAR  ` .

  - `  RENEWAL_PLAN  ` : the [renewal](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#renew-commitments) plan
    
    This applies only if the `  PLAN_TYPE  ` is `  ANNUAL  ` .

  - `  COMMITMENT_ID  ` : the ID of the commitment
    
    To get the ID, see [View purchased commitments](#view-commitments) .

### Split a commitment

You can split your commitment into two commitments. This can be useful if you want to [renew](#renewing-commitments) part of a commitment. For example, if you have an annual commitment of 1,000 slots, you could split off 300 slots into a new commitment, leaving 700 slots in the original commitment. You could then renew 700 slots at the annual rate, and convert 300 slots to a three-year commitment. You can split a commitment in increments of 50 slots.

When you split a commitment, the new commitment has the same plan and the same commitment end date as the original commitment.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Capacity management** .

3.  Click the **Slot commitments** tab.

4.  Select the commitment that you want to split.

5.  Click **Split** .

6.  In the **Split commitment** page, use the **Configure split** slider to select how many slots go into each split, in increments of 50 slots.

7.  Click **Split** to split the commitment. The new commitment is listed in the **Slot commitments** tab.

### bq

To split commitments, use the `  bq update  ` command.

``` text
bq update \
    --project_id=ADMIN_PROJECT_ID \
    --location=LOCATION \
    --split \
    --slots=SLOTS_TO_SPLIT \
    --capacity_commitment=true \
    COMMITMENT_ID
```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID

  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the commitment

  - `  SLOTS_TO_SPLIT  ` : the number of slots to split from the original commitment into a new commitment

  - `  COMMITMENT_ID  ` : the ID of the commitment
    
    To get the ID, see [View purchased commitments](#view-commitments) .

### Merge two commitments

You can merge multiple commitments into one commitment. The merging commitments must all be of the same type ( `  ANNUAL  ` or `  THREE_YEAR  ` ). The end date of the combined commitment is the maximum end date of the original commitments. If any of the commitments have an earlier end date, they are extended to the later date and you are charged a prorated amount for those slots.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Capacity management** .

3.  Click the **Slot commitments** tab.

4.  Select the commitments that you want to merge.

5.  Click **Merge** .

6.  In the **Merge commitments** page, review the details of the merge and click **Merge** . The new merged commitment is listed in the **Slot commitments** tab.

### bq

To merge two commitments into one commitment, use the `  bq update  ` command:

``` text
bq update \
    --project_id=ADMIN_PROJECT_ID \
    --location=LOCATION \
    --merge=true \
    --capacity_commitment=true \
    COMMITMENT1,COMMITMENT2
```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the commitments
  - `  COMMITMENT1  ` : the first commitment to merge
  - `  COMMITMENT2  ` : the second commitment to merge

### Upgrade commitments to a new edition

You can't directly upgrade a commitment to a new edition. For example, you can't upgrade a commitment from the Enterprise edition to the Enterprise Plus edition. Instead, follow these steps to upgrade a commitment:

1.  [Create a new commitment](#purchase-commitment) . Choose the appropriate upgraded edition. Note that this new commitment has a different commitment end date than your existing commitment.

2.  [Contact support](/bigquery/docs/getting-support) to request a cancellation of your existing commitment.

## Commitment expiration

Commitments expire at the end of their duration. You can't delete a commitment while it is still active. If the renewal plan is set to `  NONE  ` , the commitment is automatically deleted. Otherwise it is renewed with an annual or three-year commitment, depending on the renewal plan. To change the renewal plan to `  NONE  ` , follow the steps in [Renew a commitment](#renewing-commitments) .

After renewing a commitment, the value of **Start time** isn't changed. It refers to the start time of the original commitment. The value of **End time** is the time the renewed commitment expires. For example, if you have one annual commitment created on December 13, 2022, and it's renewed on December 13, 2023. If you view the commitment details on December 14, 2023, the value of **Start time** would be December 13, 2022 and the value of **End time** would be December 12, 2024.

Baseline slots are always charged. If a capacity commitment expires you might need to manually adjust the amount of baseline slots in your reservations to avoid any unwanted charges. For example, consider that you have a 1-year commitment with 100 slots and a reservation with 100 baseline slots. The commitment expires and doesn't have a renewal plan. Once the commitment expires, you pay for 100 baseline slots at the [pay as you go rate](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#capacity_compute_analysis_pricing) .

## Control the creation of capacity commitments

You can use [IAM deny policies](/iam/docs/deny-overview) for additional control over who can create capacity commitments.

Deny policies can be created for a set of users or all, and they can be configured with exceptions and conditions.

For example, the following policy denies all users the permission to create capacity commitments with the exception of the principal "lucian@example.com":

``` text
{
  "deniedPrincipals": [
    "principalSet://goog/public:all"
  ],
  "deniedPermissions": [
    "bigquery.googleapis.com/capacityCommitments.create"
  ],
  "exceptionPrincipals": [
    "principal://goog/subject/lucian@example.com"
  ]
}
```

This policy can then be attached to an organization to control who can create the commitments.

Note that these policies take precedence over the IAM roles, so even a user with the `  bigquery.admin  ` role wouldn't be able to create a commitment unless the policy is deleted or modified.

For more information, see [Deny access to resources](/iam/docs/deny-access) .

## Troubleshooting capacity commitments

This section describes troubleshooting steps that you might find helpful if you run into problems using BigQuery Reservations.

### Purchased slots are pending

Slots are subject to available capacity. When you purchase slot commitments and BigQuery allocates them, then the **Status** column shows a check mark. If BigQuery can't allocate the requested slots immediately, then the **Status** column remains pending. You might have to wait several hours for the slots to become available. If you need access to slots sooner, try the following:

1.  Delete the pending commitment.
2.  Purchase a new commitment for a smaller number of slots. Depending on capacity, the smaller commitment might become active immediately.
3.  Purchase the remaining slots as a separate commitment. These slots might show as pending in the **Status** column, but they generally become active within a few hours.
4.  Optional: When both commitments are available, you can [merge](#merging-commitments) them into a single commitment, as long as you purchased the same plan for both.

If a slot commitment fails or takes a long time to complete, consider using [on-demand pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#on_demand_pricing) temporarily. With this solution, you might need to run critical queries on a different project that's not assigned to any reservations, or you might need to remove the project assignment altogether.
