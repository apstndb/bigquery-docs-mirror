# Load Campaign Manager data into BigQuery

You can load data from Campaign Manager to BigQuery using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Campaign Manager connector. With the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, you can schedule recurring transfer jobs that add your latest data from your Campaign Manager to BigQuery.

## Connector overview

The BigQuery Data Transfer Service for the Campaign Manager connector supports the following options for your data transfer.

For information on how Campaign Manager reports are transformed into BigQuery tables and views, see [Campaign Manager report transformations](/bigquery/docs/doubleclick-campaign-transformation) .

## Data ingestion from Campaign Manager transfers

When you transfer data from Campaign Manager into BigQuery, the data is loaded into BigQuery tables that are partitioned by date. The table partition that the data is loaded into corresponds to the date from the data source. If you schedule multiple transfers for the same date, BigQuery Data Transfer Service overwrites the partition for that specific date with the latest data. Multiple transfers in the same day or running backfills don't result in duplicate data, and partitions for other dates are not affected.

### Refresh windows

A *refresh window* is the number of days that a data transfer retrieves data when a data transfer occurs. For example, if the refresh window is three days and a daily transfer occurs, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service retrieves all data from your source table from the past three days. In this example, when a daily transfer occurs, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service creates a new BigQuery destination table partition with a copy of your source table data from the current day, then automatically triggers backfill runs to update the BigQuery destination table partitions with your source table data from the past two days. The automatically triggered backfill runs will either overwrite or incrementally update your BigQuery destination table, depending on whether or not incremental updates are supported in the BigQuery Data Transfer Service connector.

When you run a data transfer for the first time, the data transfer retrieves all source data available within the refresh window. For example, if the refresh window is three days and you run the data transfer for the first time, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service retrieves all source data within three days.

To retrieve data outside the refresh window, such as historical data, or to recover data from any transfer outages or gaps, you can initiate or schedule a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .

## Before you begin

Before you create a Campaign Manager data transfer:

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .

  - [Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store the Campaign Manager data.

  - **Ensure that your organization has access to Campaign Manager Data Transfer** **v2 (Campaign Manager DTv2) files.** These files are delivered by the Campaign Manager team to a Cloud Storage bucket. To gain access to Campaign Manager DTv2 files, your next step depends on if you have a direct contract with Campaign Manager. In both cases, additional charges might apply.
    
      - If you have a contract with Campaign Manager, contact [Campaign Manager support](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/9026876?&ref_topic=2834087&visit_id=1-636444821343154346-869320595&rd=2) to setup Campaign Manager DTv2 files.
      - If you do **not** have a contract with Campaign Manager, your agency or Campaign Manager reseller may have access to Campaign Manager DTv2 files. Contact your agency or reseller for access to these files.
    
    After completing this step, you will receive a Cloud Storage bucket name similar to the following:
    
    `  dcdt_-dcm_account123456  `
    
    The Google Cloud team doesn't have the ability to generate or grant access to Campaign Manager DTv2 files on your behalf. Contact Campaign Manager [support](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/9026876?&ref_topic=2834087&visit_id=1-636444821343154346-869320595&rd=2) , your agency, or your Campaign Manager reseller for access to Campaign Manager DTv2 files.

  - If you intend to set up transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, you must have `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` permissions. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

## Required permissions

Ensure that you have granted the following permissions.

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer:

  - BigQuery Data Transfer Service permissions:
      - `  bigquery.transfers.update  `
      - `  bigquery.transfers.get  `
  - BigQuery permissions:
      - `  bigquery.datasets.get  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.update  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information, see [Grant `  bigquery.admin  ` access](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service#grant_bigqueryadmin_access) .

### Required Campaign Manager roles

Grant read access to the Campaign Manager DTv2 files stored in Cloud Storage. Access is managed by the entity from which you received the Cloud Storage bucket.

## Set up a Campaign Manager transfer

Setting up a Campaign Manager data transfer requires a:

  - **Cloud Storage bucket** : The Cloud Storage bucket URI for your Campaign Manager DTv2 files as described in [Before you begin](/bigquery/docs/doubleclick-campaign-transfer#before_you_begin) . The bucket name should look like the following:
    
    `  dcdt_-dcm_account123456  `

  - **Campaign Manager ID** : Your Campaign Manager Network, Advertiser, or Floodlight ID. Network ID is the parent in the hierarchy.

### Find your Campaign Manager ID

To retrieve your Campaign Manager ID, you can use the Cloud Storage [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage) to examine the files in your Campaign Manager Data Transfer Cloud Storage bucket. The Campaign Manager ID is used to match files in the provided Cloud Storage bucket. The ID is embedded in the **file name** , not the Cloud Storage bucket name.

For example:

  - In a file named `  dcm_account 123456 _activity_*  ` , the ID is **123456** .
  - In a file named `  dcm_floodlight 7890 _activity_*  ` , the ID is **7890** .
  - In a file named `  dcm_advertiser 567 _activity_*  ` , the ID is **567** .

### Finding your filename prefix

In rare cases, the files in your Cloud Storage bucket may have custom, nonstandard file names that were set up for you by the Google Marketing Platform services team.

For example:

  - In a file named `  dcm_account123456 custom _activity_*  ` , the prefix is **dcm\_account123456custom** — everything before `  _activity  ` .

Contact [Campaign Manager support](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/9026876?&ref_topic=2834087&visit_id=1-636444821343154346-869320595&rd=2) if you need help.

### Create a data transfer for Campaign Manager

### Console

1.  Go to the Data transfers page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  Click add **Create transfer** .

3.  On the **Create Transfer** page:
    
      - In the **Source type** section, for **Source** , choose **Campaign Manager** .
    
      - In the **Transfer config name** section, for **Display name** , enter a name for the data transfer such as `  My Transfer  ` . The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.
    
      - In the **Schedule options** section, for **Schedule** , leave the default value ( **Start now** ) or click **Start at a set time** .
        
          - For **Repeats** , choose an option for how often to run the transfer. If you choose an option other than **Daily** , additional options are available. For example, if you choose **Weekly** , an option appears for you to select the day of the week.
          - For **Start date and run time** , enter the date and time to start the data transfer. If you choose **Start now** , this option is disabled.
    
      - In the **Destination settings** section, for **Destination dataset** , choose the dataset you created to store your data.
    
      - In the **Data source details** section:
        
          - For **Cloud Storage bucket** , enter or browse for the name of the Cloud Storage bucket that stores your Data Transfer V2.0 files. When you enter the bucket name, don't include `  gs://  ` .
          - For **DoubleClick ID** , enter the appropriate Campaign Manager ID.
          - (Optional) If your files have [standard names like these examples](/bigquery/docs/doubleclick-campaign-transfer#find-id) , leave the **File name prefix** field blank. Specify a [filename prefix](/bigquery/docs/doubleclick-campaign-transfer#filename-prefix) if the files in your Cloud Storage bucket have custom file names.
    
      - (Optional) In the **Notification options** section:
        
          - Click the toggle to enable email notifications. When you enable this option, the transfer administrator receives an email notification when a transfer run fails.
          - For **Select a Pub/Sub topic** , choose your [topic](/pubsub/docs/overview) name or click **Create a topic** . This option configures Pub/Sub run [notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) for your transfer.

4.  Click **Save** .

### bq

Enter the `  bq mk  ` command and supply the transfer creation flag — `  --transfer_config  ` . The following flags are also required:

  - `  --data_source  `
  - `  --target_dataset  `
  - `  --display_name  `
  - `  --params  `

<!-- end list -->

``` text
bq mk --transfer_config \
--project_id=project_id \
--target_dataset=dataset \
--display_name=name \
--params='parameters' \
--data_source=data_source
```

Where:

  - project\_id is your project ID.
  - dataset is the target dataset for the data transfer configuration.
  - name is the display name for the data transfer configuration. The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.
  - parameters contains the parameters for the created data transfer configuration in JSON format. For example: `  --params='{"param":"param_value"}'  ` . For Campaign Manager, you must supply the `  bucket  ` and `  network_id  ` , parameters. `  bucket  ` is the Cloud Storage bucket that contains your Campaign Manager DTv2 files. `  network_id  ` is your network, floodlight, or advertiser ID.
  - data\_source is the data source — `  dcm_dt  ` (Campaign Manager).

**Caution:** You cannot configure notifications using the command-line tool.

You can also supply the `  --project_id  ` flag to specify a particular project. If `  --project_id  ` isn't specified, the default project is used.

For example, the following command creates a Campaign Manager data transfer named `  My Transfer  ` using Campaign Manager ID `  123456  ` , Cloud Storage bucket `  dcdt_-dcm_account123456  ` , and target dataset `  mydataset  ` . The parameter `  file_name_prefix  ` is optional and used for rare, custom file names only.

The data transfer is created in the default project:

``` text
bq mk --transfer_config \
--target_dataset=mydataset \
--display_name='My Transfer' \
--params='{"bucket": "dcdt_-dcm_account123456","network_id": "123456","file_name_prefix":"YYY"}' \
--data_source=dcm_dt
```

After running the command, you receive a message like the following:

`  [URL omitted] Please copy and paste the above URL into your web browser and follow the instructions to retrieve an authentication code.  `

Follow the instructions and paste the authentication code on the command line.

**Caution:** When you create a Campaign Manager data transfer using the command-line tool, the transfer configuration is set up using the default value for **Schedule** (every 8 hours).

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.transferConfigs.create  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create) method and supply an instance of the [`  TransferConfig  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs#TransferConfig) resource.

**Warning:** If you change the schema of a report, all files on that day must have the same schema, or the data transfer for the entire day will fail.

## Troubleshoot Campaign Manager transfer setup

If you are having issues setting up your data transfer, see [Campaign Manager transfer issues](/bigquery/docs/transfer-troubleshooting#campaign_manager_transfer_issues) in [Troubleshooting transfer configurations](/bigquery/docs/transfer-troubleshooting) .

## Query your data

When your data is transferred to BigQuery, the data is written to ingestion-time partitioned tables. For more information, see [Introduction to partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) .

If you query your tables directly instead of using the auto-generated views, you must use the `  _PARTITIONTIME  ` pseudocolumn in your query. For more information, see [Querying partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) .

## Campaign Manager sample queries

You can use the following Campaign Manager sample queries to analyze your transferred data. You can also use the queries in a visualization tool such as [Looker Studio](https://www.google.com/analytics/data-studio/) . These queries are provided to help you get started on querying your Campaign Manager data with BigQuery. For additional questions on what you can do with these reports, contact your Campaign Manager technical representative.

**Note:** If you query your tables directly instead of using the auto-generated views, you must use the `  _PARTITIONTIME  ` pseudocolumn in your query. For more information, see [Querying partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) .

In each of the following queries, replace the variables like dataset with your values.

### Latest campaigns

The following SQL sample query retrieves the latest campaigns.

``` text
