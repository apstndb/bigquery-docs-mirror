# Create materialized views

**Note:** This feature may not be available when using reservations that are created with certain BigQuery editions. For more information about which features are enabled in each edition, see [Introduction to BigQuery editions](/bigquery/docs/editions-intro) .

This document describes how to create materialized views in BigQuery. Before you read this document, familiarize yourself with [Introduction to materialized views](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro) .

## Before you begin

Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that give users the necessary permissions to perform each task in this document.

### Required permissions

To create materialized views, you need the `  bigquery.tables.create  ` IAM permission.

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need in order to create a materialized view:

  - `  bigquery.dataEditor  `
  - `  bigquery.dataOwner  `
  - `  bigquery.admin  `

For more information about BigQuery Identity and Access Management (IAM), see [Access control with IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

## Create materialized views

To create a materialized view, select one of the following options:

### SQL

Use the [`  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW  ` statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_materialized_view_statement) . The following example creates a materialized view for the number of clicks for each product ID:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW PROJECT_ID.DATASET.MATERIALIZED_VIEW_NAME AS (
      QUERY_EXPRESSION
    );
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the name of your project in which you want to create the materialized view—for example, `  myproject  ` .
      - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the BigQuery dataset that you want to create the materialized view in—for example, `  mydataset  ` . If you are creating a materialized view over an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) BigLake table ( [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ), make sure the dataset is in a [supported region](/bigquery/docs/omni-introduction#locations) .
      - `  MATERIALIZED_VIEW_NAME  ` : the name of the materialized view that you want to create—for example, `  my_mv  ` .
      - `  QUERY_EXPRESSION  ` : the GoogleSQL query expression that defines the materialized view—for example, `  SELECT product_id, SUM(clicks) AS sum_clicks FROM mydataset.my_source_table  ` .

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

**Example**

The following example creates a materialized view for the number of clicks for each product ID:

``` text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW myproject.mydataset.my_mv_table AS (
  SELECT
    product_id,
    SUM(clicks) AS sum_clicks
  FROM
    myproject.mydataset.my_base_table
  GROUP BY
    product_id
);
```

### Terraform

Use the [`  google_bigquery_table  `](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/bigquery_table) resource.

**Note:** To create BigQuery objects using Terraform, you must enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](/resource-manager/reference/rest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

The following example creates a view named `  my_materialized_view  ` :

``` terraform
resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "default" {
  dataset_id                      = "mydataset"
  default_partition_expiration_ms = 2592000000  # 30 days
  default_table_expiration_ms     = 31536000000 # 365 days
  description                     = "dataset description"
  location                        = "US"
  max_time_travel_hours           = 96 # 4 days

  labels = {
    billing_group = "accounting",
    pii           = "sensitive"
  }
}

resource "google_bigquery_table" "default" {
  dataset_id = google_bigquery_dataset.default.dataset_id
  table_id   = "my_materialized_view"

  materialized_view {
    query                            = "SELECT ID, description, date_created FROM `myproject.orders.items`"
    enable_refresh                   = "true"
    refresh_interval_ms              = 172800000 # 2 days
    allow_non_incremental_definition = "false"
  }

}
```

To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.

## Prepare Cloud Shell

1.  Launch [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) .

2.  Set the default Google Cloud project where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
    
    You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
    
    ``` text
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PROJECT_ID
    ```
    
    Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform configuration file.

## Prepare the directory

Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also called a *root module* ).

1.  In [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) , create a directory and a new file within that directory. The filename must have the `  .tf  ` extension—for example `  main.tf  ` . In this tutorial, the file is referred to as `  main.tf  ` .
    
    ``` text
    mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
    ```

2.  If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
    
    Copy the sample code into the newly created `  main.tf  ` .
    
    Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.

3.  Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.

4.  Save your changes.

5.  Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
    
    ``` text
    terraform init
    ```
    
    Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the `  -upgrade  ` option:
    
    ``` text
    terraform init -upgrade
    ```

## Apply the changes

1.  Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or update match your expectations:
    
    ``` text
    terraform plan
    ```
    
    Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.

2.  Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering `  yes  ` at the prompt:
    
    ``` text
    terraform apply
    ```
    
    Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete\!" message.

3.  [Open your Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to view the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure that Terraform has created or updated them.

**Note:** Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project.

### API

Call the [`  tables.insert  ` method](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/insert) and pass in a [`  Table  ` resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables#Table) with a defined `  materializedView  ` field:

``` text
{
  "kind": "bigquery#table",
  "tableReference": {
    "projectId": "PROJECT_ID",
    "datasetId": "DATASET",
    "tableId": "MATERIALIZED_VIEW_NAME"
  },
  "materializedView": {
    "query": "QUERY_EXPRESSION"
  }
}
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the name of your project in which you want to create the materialized view—for example, `  myproject  ` .
  - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the BigQuery dataset that you want to create the materialized view in—for example, `  mydataset  ` . If you are creating a materialized view over an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) BigLake table ( [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ), make sure the dataset is in a [supported region](/bigquery/docs/omni-introduction#locations) .
  - `  MATERIALIZED_VIEW_NAME  ` : the name of the materialized view that you want to create—for example, `  my_mv  ` .
  - `  QUERY_EXPRESSION  ` : the GoogleSQL query expression that defines the materialized view—for example, `  SELECT product_id, SUM(clicks) AS sum_clicks FROM mydataset.my_source_table  ` .

**Example**

The following example creates a materialized view for the number of clicks for each product ID:

``` text
{
  "kind": "bigquery#table",
  "tableReference": {
    "projectId": "myproject",
    "datasetId": "mydataset",
    "tableId": "my_mv"
  },
  "materializedView": {
    "query": "select product_id,sum(clicks) as
                sum_clicks from myproject.mydataset.my_source_table
                group by 1"
  }
}
```

### Java

Before trying this sample, follow the Java setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Java API reference documentation](/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-bigquery/latest/overview) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

``` java
import com.google.cloud.bigquery.BigQuery;
import com.google.cloud.bigquery.BigQueryException;
import com.google.cloud.bigquery.BigQueryOptions;
import com.google.cloud.bigquery.MaterializedViewDefinition;
import com.google.cloud.bigquery.TableId;
import com.google.cloud.bigquery.TableInfo;

// Sample to create materialized view
public class CreateMaterializedView {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // TODO(developer): Replace these variables before running the sample.
    String datasetName = "MY_DATASET_NAME";
    String tableName = "MY_TABLE_NAME";
    String materializedViewName = "MY_MATERIALIZED_VIEW_NAME";
    String query =
        String.format(
            "SELECT MAX(TimestampField) AS TimestampField, StringField, "
                + "MAX(BooleanField) AS BooleanField "
                + "FROM %s.%s GROUP BY StringField",
            datasetName, tableName);
    createMaterializedView(datasetName, materializedViewName, query);
  }

  public static void createMaterializedView(
      String datasetName, String materializedViewName, String query) {
    try {
      // Initialize client that will be used to send requests. This client only needs to be created
      // once, and can be reused for multiple requests.
      BigQuery bigquery = BigQueryOptions.getDefaultInstance().getService();

      TableId tableId = TableId.of(datasetName, materializedViewName);

      MaterializedViewDefinition materializedViewDefinition =
          MaterializedViewDefinition.newBuilder(query).build();

      bigquery.create(TableInfo.of(tableId, materializedViewDefinition));
      System.out.println("Materialized view created successfully");
    } catch (BigQueryException e) {
      System.out.println("Materialized view was not created. \n" + e.toString());
    }
  }
}
```

After the materialized view is successfully created, it appears in the **Explorer** pane of BigQuery in the Google Cloud console. The following example shows a materialized view schema:

Unless you disable [automatic refresh](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-manage#automatic-refresh) , BigQuery starts an asynchronous full refresh for the materialized view. The query finishes quickly, but the initial refresh might continue to run.

**Note:** Each base table is limited to 100 materialized views within the same project, and 500 materialized views within the same organization.

## Access control

You can grant access to a materialized view at the [dataset level](/bigquery/docs/dataset-access-controls) , the [view level](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views) , or the [column level](/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro) . You can also set access at a higher level in the [IAM resource hierarchy](/iam/docs/resource-hierarchy-access-control) .

Querying a materialized view requires access to the view as well as its base tables. To share a materialized view, you can grant permissions to the base tables or configure a materialized view as an authorized view. For more information, see [Authorized views](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views) .

To control access to views in BigQuery, see [Authorized views](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views) .

## Materialized views query support

Materialized views use a restricted SQL syntax. Queries must use the following pattern:

``` text
[ WITH cte [, …]]
SELECT  [{ ALL | DISTINCT }]
  expression [ [ AS ] alias ] [, ...]
FROM from_item [, ...]
[ WHERE bool_expression ]
[ GROUP BY expression [, ...] ]

from_item:
    {
      table_name [ as_alias ]
      | { join_operation | ( join_operation ) }
      | field_path
      | unnest_operator
      | cte_name [ as_alias ]
    }

as_alias:
    [ AS ] alias
```

### Query limitations

Materialized views have the following limitations.

#### Aggregate requirements

Aggregates in the materialized view query must be outputs. Computing, filtering, or joining based on an aggregated value is not supported. For example, creating a view from the following query is not supported because it produces a value computed from an aggregate, `  COUNT(*) / 10 as cnt  ` .

``` text
SELECT TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(ts, HOUR) AS ts_hour, COUNT(*) / 10 AS cnt
FROM mydataset.mytable
GROUP BY ts_hour;
```

Only the following aggregation functions are supported:

  - `  ANY_VALUE  ` (but not over `  STRUCT  ` )
  - `  APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT  `
  - `  ARRAY_AGG  ` (but not over `  ARRAY  ` or `  STRUCT  ` )
  - `  AVG  `
  - `  BIT_AND  `
  - `  BIT_OR  `
  - `  BIT_XOR  `
  - `  COUNT  `
  - `  COUNTIF  `
  - `  HLL_COUNT.INIT  `
  - `  LOGICAL_AND  `
  - `  LOGICAL_OR  `
  - `  MAX  `
  - `  MIN  `
  - `  MAX_BY  ` (but not over `  STRUCT  ` )
  - `  MIN_BY  ` (but not over `  STRUCT  ` )
  - `  SUM  `

#### Unsupported SQL features

The following SQL features are not supported in materialized views:

  - `  UNION ALL  ` . ( [Support in science Preview](#left-union) )
  - `  LEFT OUTER JOIN  ` ( [Support in science Preview](#left-union) )
  - `  RIGHT/FULL OUTER JOIN  ` .
  - Self-joins, also known as using a `  JOIN  ` on the same table more than once.
  - [Window functions](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/window-function-calls) .
  - `  ARRAY  ` subqueries.
  - Non-deterministic functions such as `  RAND()  ` , `  CURRENT_DATE()  ` , `  SESSION_USER()  ` , or `  CURRENT_TIME()  ` .
  - [User-defined functions (UDFs)](/bigquery/docs/user-defined-functions) .
  - `  TABLESAMPLE  ` .
  - `  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  ` .
  - [Generative AI functions](/bigquery/docs/generative-ai-overview) .

##### `     LEFT OUTER JOIN    ` and `     UNION ALL    ` support

**Preview**

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) . Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

To request feedback or support for this feature, send an email to [bq-mv-help @google.com](mailto:bq-mv-help@google.com) .

Incremental materialized views support `  LEFT OUTER JOIN  ` and `  UNION ALL  ` . Materialized views with `  LEFT OUTER JOIN  ` and `  UNION ALL  ` statements share the limitations of other incremental materialized views. In addition, [smart tuning](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-use#smart_tuning) is not supported for materialized views with union all or left outer join.

###### Examples

The following example creates an aggregate incremental materialized view with a `  LEFT JOIN  ` . This view is incrementally updated when data appends to the left table.

``` text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dataset.mv
AS (
  SELECT
    s_store_sk,
    s_country,
    s_zip,
    SUM(ss_net_paid) AS sum_sales,
  FROM dataset.store_sales
  LEFT JOIN dataset.store
    ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
);
```

The following example creates an aggregate incremental materialized view with a `  UNION ALL  ` . This view is incrementally updated when data appends to either or both tables. For more information about incremental updates, see [Incremental Updates](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-use#incremental_updates) .

``` text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dataset.mv PARTITION BY DATE(ts_hour)
AS (
  SELECT
    SELECT TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(ts, HOUR) AS ts_hour, SUM(sales) sum_sales
  FROM
    (SELECT ts, sales from dataset.table1 UNION ALL
     SELECT ts, sales from dataset.table2)
  GROUP BY 1
);
```

#### Access control restrictions

  - If a user's query of a materialized view includes base table columns that they cannot access due to column-level security, then the query fails with the message `  Access Denied  ` .
  - If a user queries a materialized view but doesn't have full access to all rows in the materialized views' base tables, then BigQuery runs the query against the base tables instead of reading materialized view data. This ensures the query respects all access control constraints. This limitation also applies when querying tables with data-masked columns.

### `     WITH    ` clause and common table expressions (CTEs)

Materialized views support `  WITH  ` clauses and common table expressions. Materialized views with `  WITH  ` clauses must still follow the pattern and limitations of materialized views without `  WITH  ` clauses.

#### Examples

The following example shows a materialized view using a `  WITH  ` clause:

``` text
WITH tmp AS (
  SELECT TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(ts, HOUR) AS ts_hour, *
  FROM mydataset.mytable
)
SELECT ts_hour, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM tmp
GROUP BY ts_hour;
```

The following example shows a materialized view using a `  WITH  ` clause that is not supported because it contains two `  GROUP BY  ` clauses:

``` text
WITH tmp AS (
  SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS population
  FROM mydataset.mytable
  GROUP BY city
)
SELECT population, COUNT(*) AS cnt
GROUP BY population;
```

### Materialized views over BigLake tables

**Important:** The term "BigLake" on this page refers to an access delegation functionality for external tables in BigQuery. For information about BigLake, the stand-alone Google Cloud product that includes BigLake metastore, the Apache Iceberg REST catalog, and BigLake tables for Apache Iceberg see [BigLake overview](/biglake/docs/introduction) .

To create [materialized views over BigLake tables](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#biglake) , the BigLake table must have [metadata caching enabled](/bigquery/docs/biglake-intro#metadata_caching_for_performance) over Cloud Storage data and the materialized view must have a [`  max_staleness  `](#max_staleness) option value greater than the base table. Materialized views over BigLake tables support the [same set of queries](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-create#query_limitations) as other materialized views.

#### Example

Creation of a simple aggregate view using a BigLake base table:

``` text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sample_dataset.sample_mv
    OPTIONS (max_staleness=INTERVAL "0:30:0" HOUR TO SECOND)
AS SELECT COUNT(*) cnt
FROM dataset.biglake_base_table;
```

For details about the limitations of materialized views over BigLake tables, see [materialized views over BigLake tables](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#biglake) .

### Materialized views over Apache Iceberg external tables

You can reference large Iceberg tables in materialized views instead of migrating that data to BigQuery-managed storage.

#### Create a materialized view over an Iceberg table

The following example creates a partition-aligned materialized view over a partitioned base Iceberg table:

``` text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mydataset.myicebergmv
  PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC(birth_month, MONTH)
AS
  SELECT * FROM mydataset.myicebergtable;
```

The underlying base Iceberg table `  myicebergtable  ` must have a [partition spec](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#partition-specs) like the following:

``` text
  "partition-specs" : [ {
    "spec-id" : 0,
    "fields" : [ {
    "name" : "birth_month",
    "transform" : "month",
    "source-id" : 3,
    "field-id" : 1000
    } ]
  } ]
```

#### Limitations

In addition to the [limitations](/bigquery/docs/iceberg-external-tables#limitations) of standard Iceberg tables, materialized views over Iceberg tables have the following limitations:

  - You can create a materialized view that is partition aligned with the base table. However, the materialized view only supports time-based [partition transformation](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#partition-transforms) , for example, `  YEAR  ` , `  MONTH  ` , `  DAY  ` , and `  HOUR  ` .
  - The granularity of the materialized view's partition cannot be finer than the granularity of the base table's partition. For example, if you partition the base table yearly using the `  birth_date  ` column, creating a materialized view with `  PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC(birth_date, MONTH)  ` isn't supported.
  - If the base Iceberg tables have changes across more than 4000 partitions, the materialized view is fully invalidated upon refresh, even if it's partitioned.
  - [Partition evolutions](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#partition-evolution) are supported. However, changing the partitioning columns of a base table without recreating the materialized view might result in full invalidation that cannot be fixed by refreshing the materialized view.
  - There must be at least one snapshot in the base table.
  - The Iceberg table must be a BigLake table, for example, an authorized external table.
  - The query over the materialized view might fail if the `  metadata.json  ` file of your Iceberg table is corrupted.
  - If [VPC Service Controls](/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview) is enabled, service accounts of the authorized external table must be added to your ingress rules, otherwise, VPC Service Controls blocks automatic background refresh for the materialized view.

The `  metadata.json  ` file of your Iceberg table must have the following specifications. Without these specifications, your queries scan the base table, failing to use the materialized result.

  - In [table metadata](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#table-metadata) :
    
      - `  current-snapshot-id  `
      - `  current-schema-id  `
      - `  snapshots  `
      - `  snapshot-log  `

  - In [snapshots](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#snapshots) :
    
      - `  parent-snapshot-id  ` (if available)
      - `  schema-id  `
      - `  operation  ` (in the `  summary  ` field)

  - [Partitioning](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#partitioning) (for the partitioned materialized view)

### Partitioned materialized views

Materialized views on partitioned tables can be partitioned. Partitioning a materialized view is similar to partitioning a normal table, in that it provides benefit when queries often access a subset of the partitions. In addition, partitioning a materialized view can improve the view's behavior when data in the base table or tables is modified or deleted. For more information, see [Partition alignment](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-use#partition_alignment) .

If the base table is partitioned, then you can partition a materialized view on the same partitioning column. For time-based partitions, the granularity must match (hourly, daily, monthly, or yearly). For integer-range partitions, the range specification must exactly match. You cannot partition a materialized view over a non-partitioned base table.

If the base table is partitioned by ingestion time, then a materialized view can group by the `  _PARTITIONDATE  ` column of the base table, and also partition by it. If you don't explicitly specify partitioning when you create the materialized view, then the materialized view is unpartitioned.

If the base table is partitioned, consider partitioning your materialized view as well to reduce [refresh job maintenance](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-manage) cost and query cost.

#### Partition expiration

Partition expiration can't be set on materialized views. A materialized view implicitly inherits the partition expiration time from the base table. Materialized view partitions are aligned with the base table partitions, so they expire synchronously.

**Caution:** A non-partitioned materialized view based on a table with partition expiration is invalidated and must be fully refreshed when a partition expires. Therefore, you should partition the materialized view to avoid additional refresh and query cost.

#### Example 1

In this example, the base table is partitioned on the `  transaction_time  ` column with daily partitions. The materialized view is partitioned on the same column and clustered on the `  employee_id  ` column.

``` text
CREATE TABLE my_project.my_dataset.my_base_table(
  employee_id INT64,
  transaction_time TIMESTAMP)
  PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_time)
  OPTIONS (partition_expiration_days = 2);

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_project.my_dataset.my_mv_table
  PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_time)
  CLUSTER BY employee_id
AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    transaction_time,
    COUNT(employee_id) AS cnt
  FROM
    my_dataset.my_base_table
  GROUP BY
    employee_id, transaction_time
);
```

#### Example 2

In this example, the base table is partitioned by ingestion time with daily partitions. The materialized view selects the ingestion time as a column named `  date  ` . The materialized view is grouped by the `  date  ` column and partitioned by the same column.

``` text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_project.my_dataset.my_mv_table
  PARTITION BY date
  CLUSTER BY employee_id
AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    _PARTITIONDATE AS date,
    COUNT(1) AS count
  FROM
    my_dataset.my_base_table
  GROUP BY
    employee_id,
    date
);
```

#### Example 3

In this example, the base table is partitioned on a `  TIMESTAMP  ` column named `  transaction_time  ` , with daily partitions. The materialized view defines a column named `  transaction_hour  ` , using the [`  TIMESTAMP_TRUNC  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/timestamp_functions#timestamp_trunc) function to truncate the value to the nearest hour. The materialized view is grouped by `  transaction_hour  ` and also partitioned by it.

Note the following:

  - The truncation function that is applied to the partitioning column must be at least as granular as the partitioning of the base table. For example, if the base table uses daily partitions, the truncation function cannot use `  MONTH  ` or `  YEAR  ` granularity.

  - In the materialized view's partition specification, the granularity has to match the base table.

<!-- end list -->

``` text
CREATE TABLE my_project.my_dataset.my_base_table (
  employee_id INT64,
  transaction_time TIMESTAMP)
  PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_time);

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_project.my_dataset.my_mv_table
  PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_hour)
AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(transaction_time, HOUR) AS transaction_hour,
    COUNT(employee_id) AS cnt
  FROM
    my_dataset.my_base_table
  GROUP BY
    employee_id,
    transaction_hour
);
```

### Cluster materialized views

You can cluster materialized views by their output columns, subject to the BigQuery [clustered table limitations](/bigquery/docs/clustered-tables#limitations) . Aggregate output columns cannot be used as clustering columns. Adding clustering columns to materialized views can improve the performance of queries that include filters on those columns.

Materialized view queries can reference logical views but are subject to the following limitations:

  - [Materialized view limitations apply](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#limitations) .
  - If the logical view changes, then the materialized view becomes invalid and must be fully refreshed.
  - [Smart tuning](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-use#smart_tuning) is not supported.

## Considerations when creating materialized views

### Which materialized views to create

When creating a materialized view, ensure your materialized view definition reflects query patterns against the base tables. Materialized views are more effective when they serve a broad set of queries rather than just one specific query pattern.

For example, consider a query on a table where users often filter by the columns `  user_id  ` or `  department  ` . You can group by these columns and optionally cluster by them, instead of adding filters like `  user_id = 123  ` into the materialized view.

As another example, you can use deterministic date filters, either by specific date, such as `  WHERE order_date = '2019-10-01'  ` , or date range, such as `  WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2019-10-01' AND '2019-10-31'  ` . Add a date range filter in the materialized view that covers expected date ranges in the query:

``` text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ...
  ...
  WHERE date > '2019-01-01'
  GROUP BY date
```

### Joins

The following recommendations apply to materialized views with JOINs.

#### Put the most frequently changing table first

Ensure that the largest or most frequently changing table is the first/leftmost table referenced in the view query. Materialized views with joins support incremental queries and refresh when the first or left-most table in the query is appended, but changes to other tables fully invalidate the view cache. In star or snowflake schemas the first or leftmost table should generally be the fact table.

#### Avoid joining on clustering keys

Materialized views with joins work best in cases where the data is heavily aggregated or the original join query is expensive. For selective queries, BigQuery is often already able to perform the join efficiently and no materialized view is needed. For example consider the following materialized view definitions.

``` text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dataset.mv
  CLUSTER BY s_market_id
AS (
  SELECT
    s_market_id,
    s_country,
    SUM(ss_net_paid) AS sum_sales,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt_sales
  FROM dataset.store_sales
  INNER JOIN dataset.store
    ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
  GROUP BY s_market_id, s_country
);
```

Suppose `  store_sales  ` is clustered on `  ss_store_sk  ` and you often run queries like the following:

``` text
SELECT
  SUM(ss_net_paid)
FROM dataset.store_sales
INNER JOIN dataset.store
ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
WHERE s_country = 'Germany';
```

The materialized view might not be as efficient as the original query. For best results, experiment with a representative set of queries, with and without the materialized view.

## Use materialized views with `     max_staleness    ` option

The `  max_staleness  ` materialized view option helps you achieve consistently high query performance with controlled costs when processing large, frequently changing datasets. With the `  max_staleness  ` parameter, you can reduce cost and latency on your queries by setting an interval of time where data staleness of query results is acceptable. This behavior can be useful for dashboards and reports for which fully up-to-date query results aren't essential.

### Data staleness

When you query a materialized view with the `  max_staleness  ` option set, BigQuery returns the result based on the `  max_staleness  ` value and the time at which the last refresh occurred.

If the last refresh occurred within the `  max_staleness  ` interval, then BigQuery returns data directly from the materialized view without reading the base tables. For example, this applies if your `  max_staleness  ` interval is 4 hours, and the last refresh occurred 2 hours ago.

If the last refresh occurred outside the `  max_staleness  ` interval, then BigQuery reads the data from the materialized view, combines it with changes to the base table since the last refresh, and returns the combined result. This combined result might still be stale, up to your `  max_staleness  ` interval. For example, this applies if your `  max_staleness  ` interval is 4 hours, and the last refresh occurred 7 hours ago.

### Create with `     max_staleness    ` option

Select one of the following options:

### SQL

To create a materialized view with the `  max_staleness  ` option, add an `  OPTIONS  ` clause to the DDL statement when you create the materialized view:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW  project-id.my_dataset.my_mv_table
      OPTIONS (enable_refresh = true, refresh_interval_minutes = 60,
        max_staleness = INTERVAL "4:0:0" HOUR TO SECOND)
    AS SELECT
      employee_id,
      DATE(transaction_time),
      COUNT(1) AS count
    FROM my_dataset.my_base_table
    GROUP BY 1, 2;
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - project-id is your project ID.
    
      - my\_dataset is the ID of a dataset in your project.
    
      - my\_mv\_table is the ID of the materialized view that you're creating.
    
      - my\_base\_table is the ID of a table in your dataset that serves as the base table for your materialized view.
    
      - Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### API

Call the [`  tables.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/insert) method with a defined `  materializedView  ` resource as part of your API request. The `  materializedView  ` resource contains a `  query  ` field. For example:

``` text
{
  "kind": "bigquery#table",
  "tableReference": {
    "projectId": "project-id",
    "datasetId": "my_dataset",
    "tableId": "my_mv_table"
  },
  "materializedView": {
    "query": "select product_id,sum(clicks) as
                sum_clicks from project-id.my_dataset.my_base_table
                group by 1"
  }
  "maxStaleness": "4:0:0"
}
```

Replace the following:

  - project-id is your project ID.
  - my\_dataset is the ID of a dataset in your project.
  - my\_mv\_table is the ID of the materialized view that you're creating.
  - my\_base\_table is the ID of a table in your dataset that serves as the base table for your materialized view.
  - `  product_id  ` is a column from the base table.
  - `  clicks  ` is a column from the base table.
  - `  sum_clicks  ` is a column in the materialized view that you are creating.

### Apply `     max_staleness    ` option

You can apply this parameter to existing materialized views by using the `  ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW  ` statement. For example:

``` text
ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW project-id.my_dataset.my_mv_table
SET OPTIONS (enable_refresh = true, refresh_interval_minutes = 120,
  max_staleness = INTERVAL "8:0:0" HOUR TO SECOND);
```

### Query with `     max_staleness    `

You can query materialized views with the `  max_staleness  ` option as you would query any other materialized view, logical view, or table.

For example:

``` text
SELECT * FROM  project-id.my_dataset.my_mv_table
```

This query returns data from the last refresh if the data is not older than the `  max_staleness  ` parameter. If the materialized view has not been refreshed within the `  max_staleness  ` interval, BigQuery merges the results of the latest available refresh with the base table changes to return results within the `  max_staleness  ` interval.

#### Data streaming and `     max_staleness    ` results

If you stream data into the base tables of a materialized view with the `  max_staleness  ` option, then the query of the materialized view might exclude records that were streamed into its tables before the beginning of the staleness interval. As a result, a materialized view that includes data from multiple tables and `  max_staleness  ` option might not represent a point-in-time snapshot of those tables.

### Smart tuning and the `     max_staleness    ` option

Smart tuning automatically rewrites queries to use materialized views whenever possible regardless of the `  max_staleness  ` option, even if the query does not reference a materialized view. The `  max_staleness  ` option on a materialized view does not affect the results of the rewritten query. The `  max_staleness  ` option only affects queries that directly query the materialized view.

### Manage staleness and refresh frequency

You should set `  max_staleness  ` based on your requirements. To avoid reading data from base tables, configure the refresh interval so that the refresh takes place within the staleness interval. You can account for the average refresh runtime plus a margin for growth.

For example, if one hour is required to refresh your materialized view and you want a one-hour buffer for growth, then you should set the refresh interval to two hours. This configuration ensures that the refresh occurs within your report's four-hour maximum for staleness.

``` text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW project-id.my_dataset.my_mv_table
OPTIONS (enable_refresh = true, refresh_interval_minutes = 120, max_staleness =
INTERVAL "4:0:0" HOUR TO SECOND)
AS SELECT
  employee_id,
  DATE(transaction_time),
  COUNT(1) AS cnt
FROM my_dataset.my_base_table
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

## Non-incremental materialized views

Non-incremental materialized views support most SQL queries, including `  OUTER JOIN  ` , `  UNION  ` , and `  HAVING  ` clauses, and analytic functions. To determine whether a materialized view was used in your query, check the cost estimates by using a [dry run](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#interaction) . In scenarios where data staleness is acceptable, for example for batch data processing or reporting, non-incremental materialized views can improve query performance and reduce cost. By using the `  max_staleness  ` option, you can build arbitrary, complex materialized views that are automatically maintained and have built-in staleness guarantees.

### Use non-incremental materialized views

You can create non-incremental materialized views by using the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option. This option must be accompanied by the `  max_staleness  ` option. To ensure a periodic refresh of the materialized view, you should also configure a [refresh policy](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-manage#enable_and_disable_automatic_refresh) . Without a refresh policy, you must manually refresh the materialized view.

The materialized view always represents the state of the base tables within the `  max_staleness  ` interval. If the last refresh is too stale and doesn't represent the base tables within the `  max_staleness  ` interval, then the query reads the base tables. To learn more about possible performance implications, see [Data staleness](#data_staleness) .

### Create with `     allow_non_incremental_definition    `

To create a materialized view with the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option, follow these steps. After you create the materialized view, you cannot modify the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option. For example, you cannot change the value `  true  ` to `  false  ` , or remove the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option from the materialized view.

### SQL

Add an `  OPTIONS  ` clause to the DDL statement when you create the materialized view:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_project.my_dataset.my_mv_table
    OPTIONS (
      enable_refresh = true, refresh_interval_minutes = 60,
      max_staleness = INTERVAL "4" HOUR,
        allow_non_incremental_definition = true)
    AS SELECT
      s_store_sk,
      SUM(ss_net_paid) AS sum_sales,
      APPROX_QUANTILES(ss_net_paid, 2)[safe_offset(1)] median
    FROM my_project.my_dataset.store
    LEFT OUTER JOIN my_project.my_dataset.store_sales
      ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
    GROUP BY s_store_sk
    HAVING median < 40 OR median is NULL ;
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - my\_project is your project ID.
      - my\_dataset is the ID of a dataset in your project.
      - my\_mv\_table is the ID of the materialized view that you're creating.
      - my\_dataset.store and my\_dataset.store\_sales are the IDs of the tables in your dataset that serve as the base tables for your materialized view.

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### API

Call the [`  tables.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables/insert) method with a defined `  materializedView  ` resource as part of your API request. The `  materializedView  ` resource contains a `  query  ` field. For example:

``` text
{
  "kind": "bigquery#table",
  "tableReference": {
    "projectId": "my_project",
    "datasetId": "my_dataset",
    "tableId": "my_mv_table"
  },
  "materializedView": {
    "query": "`SELECT`
        s_store_sk,
        SUM(ss_net_paid) AS sum_sales,
        APPROX_QUANTILES(ss_net_paid, 2)[safe_offset(1)] median
      FROM my_project.my_dataset.store
      LEFT OUTER JOIN my_project.my_dataset.store_sales
        ON ss_store_sk = s_store_sk
      GROUP BY s_store_sk
      HAVING median < 40 OR median is NULL`",
    "allowNonIncrementalDefinition": true
  }
  "maxStaleness": "4:0:0"
}
```

Replace the following:

  - my\_project is your project ID.
  - my\_dataset is the ID of a dataset in your project.
  - my\_mv\_table is the ID of the materialized view that you're creating.
  - my\_dataset.store and my\_dataset.store\_sales are the IDs of the tables in your dataset that serve as the base tables for your materialized view.

### Create materialized views over Spanner external datasets

**Preview**

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) . Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

Before you proceed, you must create the underlying Spanner external dataset using a [`  CLOUD_RESOURCE  ` connection](/bigquery/docs/spanner-external-datasets#use_a_cloud_resource_connection) .

You can create non-incremental materialized views that reference [Spanner external dataset tables](/bigquery/docs/spanner-external-datasets) by using the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option. The following example uses a base Spanner external dataset table:

``` text
/*
  You must create the spanner_external_dataset with a CLOUD_RESOURCE connection.
*/
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sample_dataset.sample_spanner_mv
  OPTIONS (
      enable_refresh = true, refresh_interval_minutes = 60,
      max_staleness = INTERVAL "24" HOUR,
        allow_non_incremental_definition = true)
AS
  SELECT COUNT(*) cnt FROM spanner_external_dataset.spanner_table;
```

### Query with `     allow_non_incremental_definition    `

You can query non-incremental materialized views as you would query any other materialized view, logical view, or table.

For example:

``` text
SELECT * FROM  my_project.my_dataset.my_mv_table
```

If the data is not older than the `  max_staleness  ` parameter, then this query returns data from the last refresh. For details about the staleness and freshness of data, see [data staleness](#data_staleness) .

### Limitations specific to non-incremental materialized views

The following limitations only apply to materialized views with the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option. With the exception of limitations on supported query syntax, all [materialized view limitations](/bigquery/docs/materialized-views-intro#limitations) still apply.

  - Smart-tuning is not applied to the materialized views that include the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option. The only way to benefit from materialized views with the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option is to query them directly.
  - Materialized views without the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option can incrementally refresh a subset of their data. Materialized views with the `  allow_non_incremental_definition  ` option must be refreshed in their entirety.
  - Materialized views with max\_staleness option validates presence of the column-level security constraints during query execution. See more details about this in [column-level access control](/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro#time-travel)
  - For materialized views over Spanner external dataset tables, if the last refresh of a non-incremental materialized view occurred outside the `  max_staleness  ` interval, then queries read the base Spanner external dataset tables, even if the base table hasn't changed. For example, if your `  max_staleness  ` interval is 4 hours and the last refresh occurred 7 hours ago, then the query will read the base Spanner external dataset tables.
