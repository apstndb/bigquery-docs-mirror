## Data ingestion from Google Ads transfers

When you transfer data from Google Ads into BigQuery, the data is loaded into BigQuery tables that are partitioned by date. The table partition that the data is loaded into corresponds to the date from the data source. If you schedule multiple transfers for the same date, BigQuery Data Transfer Service overwrites the partition for that specific date with the latest data. Multiple transfers in the same day or running backfills don't result in duplicate data, and partitions for other dates are not affected.

### Refresh windows

A *refresh window* is the number of days that a data transfer retrieves data when a data transfer occurs. For example, if the refresh window is three days and a daily transfer occurs, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service retrieves all data from your source table from the past three days. In this example, when a daily transfer occurs, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service creates a new BigQuery destination table partition with a copy of your source table data from the current day, then automatically triggers backfill runs to update the BigQuery destination table partitions with your source table data from the past two days. The automatically triggered backfill runs will either overwrite or incrementally update your BigQuery destination table, depending on whether or not incremental updates are supported in the BigQuery Data Transfer Service connector.

When you run a data transfer for the first time, the data transfer retrieves all source data available within the refresh window. For example, if the refresh window is three days and you run the data transfer for the first time, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service retrieves all source data within three days.

To retrieve data outside the refresh window, such as historical data, or to recover data from any transfer outages or gaps, you can initiate or schedule a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .

## Limitations

  - The maximum frequency that you can configure a Google Ads data transfer for is once every 24 hours. By default, a transfer starts at the time that you create the transfer. However, you can configure the transfer start time when you [create your transfer](/bigquery/docs/google-ads-transfer#setup-data-transfer) .
  - The BigQuery Data Transfer Service does not support incremental data transfers during a Google Ads transfer. When you specify a date for a data transfer, all of the data that is available for that date is transferred.

## Before you begin

Before you create a Google Ads data transfer, do the following:

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store the Google Ads data.
  - If you intend to set up transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, ensure that you have the `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` permission. Pub/Sub permissions are not required if you set up email notifications. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

## Required permissions

Ensure that you have granted the following permissions.

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer:

  - BigQuery Data Transfer Service permissions:
      - `  bigquery.transfers.update  `
      - `  bigquery.transfers.get  `
  - BigQuery permissions:
      - `  bigquery.datasets.get  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.update  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information, see [Grant `  bigquery.admin  ` access](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service#grant_bigqueryadmin_access) .

### Required Google Ads roles

You must grant read access to the Google Ads Customer ID or [manager account](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6139186) (MCC) that is used in the transfer configuration.

To authorize a service account for your Google Ads data transfer, we recommend that you grant the service account direct-account access to Google Ads. For more information, see [Authorization with direct account access](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/oauth/service-accounts#direct.)

## Create Google Ads data transfer

To create a data transfer for Google Ads reporting, you need either your Google Ads customer ID or your manager account (MCC). For information about retrieving your Google Ads customer ID, see [Find your Customer ID](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344) .

To create a data transfer for Google Ads reporting, select one of the following options:

### Console

10. Click **Save** .

### bq

Enter the `  bq mk  ` command and supply the transfer creation flag — `  --transfer_config  ` . The following flags are also required:

  - `  --data_source  `
  - `  --target_dataset  `
  - `  --display_name  `
  - `  --params  `

The following flags are optional:

  - `  --project_id  ` : Specifies which project to use. If the flag is not specified, the default project is used.
  - `  --table_filter  ` : Specifies which tables to include in the data transfer. If the flag is not specified, all tables are included. To include only specific tables, use a comma-separated list of values (for example, `  Ad  ` , `  Campaign  ` , `  AdGroup  ` ). To exclude specific tables, prefix the values with a hyphen ( `  -  ` ) (for example, `  -Ad  ` , `  Campaign  ` , `  AdGroup  ` ).
  - `  --schedule  ` : Specifies how often the query runs. If you don't specify `  --schedule  ` , the default is set to `  every 24 hours  ` . For information about the schedule syntax, see [Formatting the schedule](/appengine/docs/flexible/scheduling-jobs-with-cron-yaml#formatting_the_schedule) .
  - `  --refresh_window_days  ` : Specifies the refresh window for a transfer configuration in days. The default value is `  7  ` .
  - `  --service_account_name  ` : Specifies a service account to use for the Google Ads transfer authentication instead of your user account.

<!-- end list -->

      - `  customer_id  ` : enter your Google Ads customer ID. This field is required.
      - `  custom_report_table_names  ` : a list of table names for the [custom reports](#custom_reports) included in this transfer. This list corresponds to the queries in `  custom_report_queries  ` . The length of this list must match the length of the list in `  custom_report_queries  ` .
      - `  custom_report_queries  ` : a list of [Google Ads Query Language (GAQL) queries](#custom_reports) for the custom reports included in this transfer. This list corresponds to the names in `  custom_report_table_names  ` . The length of this list must match the length of the list in `  custom_report_table_names  ` .
      - Optional: set the `  exclude_removed_items  ` parameter to `  true  ` to prevent removed or disabled entities and metrics from being transferred.
  - DATA\_SOURCE is the data source — `  google_ads  ` .
  - TABLES is the comma-separated list of tables to include or exclude from the data transfer.
  - SCHEDULE is how often you want the query to run. If `  --schedule  ` isn't specified, the default is every 24 hours, starting from the time the transfer is created.
  - REFRESH\_DAYS is an integer that specifies the refresh window for a transfer configuration in days. The default value is `  7  ` .
  - SERVICE\_ACCOUNT\_NAME is the service account name used to authenticate your transfer. The service account must be owned by the same `  project_id  ` used to create the transfer and it must have all of the [required permissions](#required_permissions) .

**Caution:** You can't configure notifications using the command-line tool.

For example, the following command creates a Google Ads data transfer named `  My Transfer  ` using Customer ID `  123-123-1234  ` and target dataset `  mydataset  ` . The data transfer is created in the default project:

``` text
bq mk \
--transfer_config \
--target_dataset=mydataset \
--display_name='My Transfer' \
--params='{"customer_id":"123-123-1234","exclude_removed_items":"true"}' \
--data_source=google_ads
```

The first time you run the command, you receive a message like the following:

`  [URL omitted] Please copy and paste the above URL into your web browser and follow the instructions to retrieve an authentication code.  `

Follow the instructions in the message and paste the authentication code on the command line.

### API

## Manually trigger a Google Ads transfer

When you [manually trigger a transfer](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) for Google Ads, snapshots of Match Tables are taken once a day and stored in the partition for the latest run date. When you trigger a manual transfer, Match Table snapshots for the following tables are not updated:

  - Ad
  - AdGroup
  - AdGroupAudience
  - AdGroupBidModifier
  - AdGroupAdLabel
  - AdGroupCriterion
  - AdGroupCriterionLabel
  - AdGroupLabel
  - AgeRange
  - Asset
  - AssetGroup
  - AssetGroupAsset
  - AssetGroupListingGroupFilter
  - AssetGroupSignal
  - Audience
  - BidGoal
  - Budget
  - Campaign
  - CampaignAudience
  - CampaignCriterion
  - CampaignLabel
  - Customer
  - Gender
  - Keyword
  - LocationBasedCampaignCriterion
  - ParentalStatus
  - Placement
  - Video

## Custom reports

The BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Google Ads connector also supports the use of custom reports using Google Ads Query Language (GAQL) queries in the Google Ads transfer configuration. These custom reports ingest data from all resources available in the [Google Ads API version supported by the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](#connector_overview) . For more information about using and validating a GAQL query, see [Google Ads Query Builder](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v21/overview_query_builder) .

You can specify custom reports when you [Create a Google Ads transfer](/bigquery/docs/google-ads-transfer#setup-data-transfer) .

### Custom reports limitations

Custom reports with the Google Ads connector are subject to the following limitations:

  - The Google Ads connector doesn't support `  WHERE  ` , `  ORDER BY  ` , `  LIMIT  ` , and `  PARAMETERS  ` clauses. Your GAQL query should be in the format similar to the following: `  SELECT FIELD_NAME , FIELD_NAME ,... FROM RESOURCE_NAME  ` .
  - The Google Ads connector automatically appends `  WHERE segments.date = run_date  ` when there is a core date segment (for example, `  segments.date  ` , `  segments.week  ` , `  segments.month  ` , `  segments.quarter  ` , `  segments.year  ` ) in the query. This can cause the [Google Ads Query Validator](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v21/query_validator) to return an error, for example, `  The filtering conditions in the WHERE clause must combine to form a valid, finite date range composed of the core date segments ...  ` . You can safely ignore these errors.
  - GAQL queries without a [`  segments.date  ` field](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/fields/v21/segments#segments.date) acts as [match tables](/bigquery/docs/google-ads-transformation#google_ads_match_tables) , which are only updated once per day and are not supported in backfill runs. If you want to backfill data, you must include a `  segments.date  ` field in the GAQL query.
  - The Google Ads connector supports up to 100 custom reports in a single transfer.

## Performance Max (PMax) campaigns

The Google Ads connector lets you export [PMax campaigns](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10724817) data. You must select the **Include PMax Campaign Tables** checkbox when [creating a data transfer](#setup-data-transfer) , as PMax data is not exported by default.

Including PMax data removes `  ad_group  ` fields from certain tables and includes new tables. You cannot include `  ad_group  ` fields because the Google Ads API filters the PMax data.

The following tables exclude `  ad_group  ` related columns when the **Include PMax Campaign Tables** checkbox is selected:

  - GeoStats
  - GeoConversionStats
  - ShoppingProductConversionStats
  - ShoppingProductStats
  - LocationsUserLocationsStats

The following tables are added when the **Include PMax Campaign Tables** checkbox is selected:

  - Asset
  - AssetGroup
  - AssetGroupAsset
  - AssetGroupListingGroupFilter
  - AssetGroupSignal
  - Audience
  - AssetGroupProductGroupStats
  - CampaignAssetStats

## Support for Google Ads manager accounts

Existing customers who have multiple Customer ID-specific Google Ads Transfers are encouraged to set up a single Google Ads Transfer at the Manager Account (MCC) level, schedule a backfill, and disable individual Customer ID-specific Google Ads Transfers.

Using Google Ads manager accounts provides several benefits over using individual Customer IDs:

  - You no longer need to manage multiple data transfers to report on multiple Customer IDs.
  - Cross-customer queries are much simpler to write because all the Customer IDs are stored in the same table.
  - Using MCCs alleviates BigQuery Data Transfer Service load quota issues because multiple Customer IDs are loaded in the same job.

For more information about Google Ads manager accounts (MCCs), see [Working with managed accounts](https://support.google.com/google-ads/topic/7554359) and [About linking accounts to your manager account](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7456530) .

**Note:** The BigQuery Data Transfer Service pulls reports for all listed Customer IDs, but you may not see Customer IDs in your reports if they don't report activity for the requested day or the account is inactive when the transfer run happens.

### Example

The following list shows the Customer IDs linked to particular Google Ads manager accounts:

  - 1234567890 — root manager account
      - 1234 — sub-manager account
          - 1111 — Customer ID
          - 2222 — Customer ID
          - 3333 — Customer ID
          - 4444 — Customer ID
          - 567 — sub-manager account
              - 5555 — Customer ID
              - 6666 — Customer ID
              - 7777 — Customer ID
      - 89 — sub-manager account
          - 8888 — Customer ID
          - 9999 — Customer ID
      - 0000 — Customer ID

Each Customer ID linked to a manager account appears in each report. For more information about the Google Ads reporting structure in BigQuery Data Transfer Service, see [Google Ads report transformation](/bigquery/docs/google-ads-transformation) .

#### Transfer configuration for Customer ID 1234567890

A transfer configuration for the root manager account (Customer ID 1234567890) would generate data transfer runs that include the following Customer IDs:

  - 1111 (via sub-manager account 1234)

A transfer configuration for Customer ID 0000 would generate data transfer runs that include only the individual Customer ID:

  - 0000

### Migrate Google Ads data to MCCs

To migrate your existing Google Ads data in BigQuery Data Transfer Service to the MCC structure, you can [set up a backfill](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer_or_backfill) to add your existing data to the tables created by the transfer configuration linked to the manager account. Note that when you schedule a backfill, match tables are not updated.

## Troubleshoot Google Ads transfer setup

If you are having issues setting up your data transfer, see [Google Ads transfer issues](/bigquery/docs/transfer-troubleshooting#ads-transfer) in [Troubleshooting transfer configurations](/bigquery/docs/transfer-troubleshooting) .

## Query your data

When your data is transferred to BigQuery Data Transfer Service, the data is written to ingestion-time partitioned tables. For more information, see [Introduction to partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) .

If you query your tables directly instead of using the auto-generated views, you must use the `  _PARTITIONTIME  ` pseudocolumn in your query. For more information, see [Querying partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) .

## Google Ads sample queries

You can use the following Google Ads sample queries to analyze your transferred data. You can also use the queries in a visualization tool such as [Looker Studio](https://www.google.com/analytics/data-studio/) . These queries are provided to help you get started on querying your Google Ads data with BigQuery Data Transfer Service. For additional questions about what you can do with these reports, contact your Google Ads technical representative.

If you query your tables directly instead of using the auto-generated views, you must use the `  _PARTITIONTIME  ` pseudocolumn in your query. For more information, see [Querying partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) .

### Campaign performance

The following sample query analyzes Google Ads campaign performance for the past 30 days.

### Console

``` text
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.campaign_name,
  c.campaign_status,
  SUM(cs.metrics_impressions) AS Impressions,
  SUM(cs.metrics_interactions) AS Interactions,
  (SUM(cs.metrics_cost_micros) / 1000000) AS Cost
FROM
  `DATASET.ads_Campaign_CUSTOMER_ID` c
LEFT JOIN
  `DATASET.ads_CampaignBasicStats_CUSTOMER_ID` cs
ON
  (c.campaign_id = cs.campaign_id
  AND cs._DATA_DATE BETWEEN
  DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -31 DAY) AND DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -1 DAY))
WHERE
  c._DATA_DATE = c._LATEST_DATE
GROUP BY
  1, 2, 3
ORDER BY
  Impressions DESC
```

### bq

``` text
  bq query --use_legacy_sql=false '
  SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.campaign_name,
    c.campaign_status,
    SUM(cs.metrics_impressions) AS Impressions,
    SUM(cs.metrics_interactions) AS Interactions,
    (SUM(cs.metrics_cost_micros) / 1000000) AS Cost
  FROM
    `DATASET.ads_Campaign_CUSTOMER_ID` c
  LEFT JOIN
    `DATASET.ads_CampaignBasicStats_CUSTOMER_ID` cs
  ON
    (c.campaign_id = cs.campaign_id
    AND cs._DATA_DATE BETWEEN
    DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -31 DAY) AND DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -1 DAY))
  WHERE
    c._DATA_DATE = c._LATEST_DATE
  GROUP BY
    1, 2, 3
  ORDER BY
    Impressions DESC'
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the dataset that you created to store the transferred table
  - `  CUSTOMER_ID  ` : your Google Ads Customer ID.

### Count of keywords

The following sample query analyzes keywords by campaign, ad group, and keyword status. This query uses the `  KeywordMatchType  ` function. Keyword match types help control which searches can trigger your ad. For more information about keyword matching options, see [About keyword matching options](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2497836) .

### Console

``` text
  SELECT
    c.campaign_status AS CampaignStatus,
    a.ad_group_status AS AdGroupStatus,
    k.ad_group_criterion_status AS KeywordStatus,
    k.ad_group_criterion_keyword_match_type AS KeywordMatchType,
    COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM
    `DATASET.ads_Keyword_CUSTOMER_ID` k
    JOIN
    `DATASET.ads_Campaign_CUSTOMER_ID` c
  ON
    (k.campaign_id = c.campaign_id AND k._DATA_DATE = c._DATA_DATE)
  JOIN
    `DATASET.ads_AdGroup_CUSTOMER_ID` a
  ON
    (k.ad_group_id = a.ad_group_id AND k._DATA_DATE = a._DATA_DATE)
  WHERE
    k._DATA_DATE = k._LATEST_DATE
  GROUP BY
    1, 2, 3, 4
```

### bq

``` text
  bq query --use_legacy_sql=false '
  SELECT
    c.campaign_status AS CampaignStatus,
    a.ad_group_status AS AdGroupStatus,
    k.ad_group_criterion_status AS KeywordStatus,
    k.ad_group_criterion_keyword_match_type AS KeywordMatchType,
    COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM
    `DATASET.ads_Keyword_CUSTOMER_ID` k
  JOIN
    `DATASET.ads_Campaign_CUSTOMER_ID` c
  ON
    (k.campaign_id = c.campaign_id AND k._DATA_DATE = c._DATA_DATE)
  JOIN
    `DATASET.ads_AdGroup_CUSTOMER_ID` a
  ON
    (k.ad_group_id = a.ad_group_id AND k._DATA_DATE = a._DATA_DATE)
  WHERE
    k._DATA_DATE = k._LATEST_DATE
  GROUP BY
    1, 2, 3, 4'
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the dataset that you created to store the transferred table
  - `  CUSTOMER_ID  ` : your Google Ads Customer ID.
