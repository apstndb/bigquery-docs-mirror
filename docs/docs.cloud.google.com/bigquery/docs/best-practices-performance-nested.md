# Use nested and repeated fields

BigQuery can be used with many different data modeling methods, and generally provides high performance across many data model methodologies. To further tune a data model for performance, one method you might consider is data denormalization, which means adding columns of data to a single table to reduce or remove table joins.

**Best practice:** Use nested and repeated fields to denormalize data storage and increase query performance.

Denormalization is a common strategy for increasing read performance for relational datasets that were previously normalized. The recommended way to denormalize data in BigQuery is to use nested and repeated fields. It's best to use this strategy when the relationships are hierarchical and frequently queried together, such as in parent-child relationships.

The storage savings from using normalized data has less of an effect in modern systems. Increases in storage costs are worth the performance gains of using denormalized data. Joins require data coordination (communication bandwidth). Denormalization localizes the data to individual [slots](/bigquery/docs/slots) , so that execution can be done in parallel.

To maintain relationships while denormalizing your data, you can use nested and repeated fields instead of completely flattening your data. When relational data is completely flattened, network communication (shuffling) can negatively impact query performance.

For example, denormalizing an orders schema without using nested and repeated fields might require you to group the data by a field like `  order_id  ` (when there is a one-to-many relationship). Because of the shuffling involved, grouping the data is less effective than denormalizing the data by using nested and repeated fields.

In some circumstances, denormalizing your data and using nested and repeated fields doesn't result in increased performance. For example, star schemas are typically optimized schemas for analytics, and as a result, performance might not be significantly different if you attempt to denormalize further.

## Using nested and repeated fields

BigQuery doesn't require a completely flat denormalization. You can use nested and repeated fields to maintain relationships.

  - Nesting data ( `  STRUCT  ` )
    
      - Nesting data lets you represent foreign entities inline.
      - Querying nested data uses "dot" syntax to reference leaf fields, which is similar to the syntax using a join.
      - Nested data is represented as a [`  STRUCT  ` type](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#struct_type) in GoogleSQL.

  - Repeated data ( `  ARRAY  ` )
    
      - Creating a field of type `  RECORD  ` with the mode set to `  REPEATED  ` lets you preserve a one-to-many relationship inline (so long as the relationship isn't high cardinality).
      - With repeated data, shuffling is not necessary.
      - Repeated data is represented as an `  ARRAY  ` . You can use an [`  ARRAY  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/array_functions) in GoogleSQL when you query the repeated data.

  - Nested and repeated data ( `  ARRAY  ` of `  STRUCT  ` s)
    
      - Nesting and repetition complement each other.
      - For example, in a table of transaction records, you could include an array of line item `  STRUCT  ` s.

For more information, see [Specify nested and repeated columns in table schemas](/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated) .

For more information about denormalizing data, see [Denormalization](/bigquery/docs/migration/schema-data-overview#denormalization) .

## Example

Consider an `  Orders  ` table with a row for each line item sold:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Order_Id</strong></th>
<th><strong>Item_Name</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>001</td>
<td>A1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>001</td>
<td>B1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>002</td>
<td>A1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>002</td>
<td>C1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If you wanted to analyze data from this table, you would need to use a `  GROUP BY  ` clause, similar to the following:

``` text
SELECT COUNT (Item_Name)
FROM Orders
GROUP BY Order_Id;
```

The `  GROUP BY  ` clause involves additional computation overhead, but this can be avoided by nesting repeated data. You can avoid using a `  GROUP BY  ` clause by creating a table with one order per row, where the order line items are in a nested field:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Order_Id</strong></th>
<th><strong>Item_Name</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>001</td>
<td>A1<br />
<br />
B1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>002</td>
<td>A1<br />
<br />
C1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

In BigQuery, you typically specify a nested schema as an `  ARRAY  ` of `  STRUCT  ` objects. You use the [`  UNNEST  ` operator](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#unnest_operator) to [flatten the nested data](/bigquery/docs/arrays#flattening_arrays) , as shown in the following query:

``` text
SELECT *
FROM UNNEST(
  [
    STRUCT('001' AS Order_Id, ['A1', 'B1'] AS Item_Name),
    STRUCT('002' AS Order_Id, ['A1', 'C1'] AS Item_Name)
  ]
);
```

This query yields results similar to the following:

If this data wasn't nested, you could potentially have several rows for each order, one for each item sold in that order, which would result in a large table and an expensive `  GROUP BY  ` operation.

## Exercise

You can see the performance difference in queries that use nested fields as compared to those that don't by following the steps in this section.

1.  Create a table based on the `  bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.comments  ` public dataset:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `PROJECT.DATASET.stackoverflow`
    AS (
    SELECT
      user_id,
      post_id,
      creation_date
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.comments`
    );
    ```

2.  Using the `  stackoverflow  ` table, run the following query to see the earliest comment for each user:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      user_id,
      ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(post_id, creation_date AS earliest_comment) ORDER BY creation_date ASC LIMIT 1)[OFFSET(0)].*
    FROM
      `PROJECT.DATASET.stackoverflow`
    GROUP BY user_id
    ORDER BY user_id ASC;
    ```
    
    This query takes about 25 seconds to run and processes 1.88 GB of data.

3.  Create a second table with identical data that creates a `  comments  ` field using a `  STRUCT  ` type to store the `  post_id  ` and `  creation_date  ` data, instead of two individual fields:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `PROJECT.DATASET.stackoverflow_nested`
    AS (
    SELECT
      user_id,
      ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(post_id, creation_date) ORDER BY creation_date ASC) AS comments
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.comments`
    GROUP BY user_id
    );
    ```

4.  Using the `  stackoverflow_nested  ` table, run the following query to see the earliest comment for each user:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      user_id,
      (SELECT AS STRUCT post_id, creation_date as earliest_comment FROM UNNEST(comments) ORDER BY creation_date ASC LIMIT 1).*
    FROM
      `PROJECT.DATASET.stackoverflow_nested`
    ORDER BY user_id ASC;
    ```
    
    This query takes about 10 seconds to run and processes 1.28 GB of data.

5.  [Delete](/bigquery/docs/samples/bigquery-delete-table) the `  stackoverflow  ` and `  stackoverflow_nested  ` tables when you are finished with them.
