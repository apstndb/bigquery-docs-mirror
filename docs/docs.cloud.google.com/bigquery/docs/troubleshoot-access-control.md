# Troubleshoot IAM permissions in BigQuery

This document shows you how to troubleshoot issues with Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions in BigQuery. IAM permission issues typically result in `  Access Denied  ` errors like the following:

  - `  Access Denied: Project PROJECT_ID : User does not have bigquery.jobs.create permission in project PROJECT_ID .  `
  - `  Access Denied: Project PROJECT_ID : User does not have bigquery.datasets.get permission on dataset DATASET .  `
  - `  User does not have permission to query table PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE .  `
  - `  Access Denied: Table PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE : User does not have permission to query table PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE , or perhaps it does not exist.  `
  - `  Access Denied: User PRINCIPAL does not have permission to perform bigquery.tables.getData on resource 'projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET /tables/ TABLE '.  `

## Before you begin

  - To troubleshoot a principal's access to a BigQuery resource, ensure that you have the [required IAM permissions](/policy-intelligence/docs/troubleshoot-access#required-permissions) .

## Gather information about the issue

The first step in troubleshooting a resource access issue is to determine the permission that is missing, the IAM principal that was denied access, and the resource the principal was attempting to access.

### Get information from the error or job history

To get information about the principal, the resource, and the permissions, examine the output from the bq command-line tool, the API response, or BigQuery in the Google Cloud console.

For example, if you attempt to run a query with insufficient permissions, you see an error like the following on the **Job information** tab in the **Query results** section of the Google Cloud console.

Examine the error to determine the principal, the resource, and the permissions.

**Note:** You can also view job details by using the [job history](/bigquery/docs/managing-jobs#view-job) .

In some cases, you may be able to request missing permissions directly from the error message. For more information, see [Permission error messages](/iam/docs/permission-error-messages) in the IAM documentation.

### Get information from the Cloud Audit Logs

If the error message is generic, missing information, or if the action failed in a background process, use the Cloud Audit Logs Logs Explorer to get information about the error.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Logs Explorer** page.
    
    Alternatively, from the navigation menu, choose **Monitoring \> Logs Explorer** .

2.  In the Logs Explorer, for the logs scope, choose **Project logs** .

3.  In the query window, enter the following query to get permission-related errors from the BigQuery data access logs:
    
    ``` text
    resource.type="bigquery_resource" AND
    logName="projects/PROJECT_ID/logs/cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Fdata_access" AND
    protoPayload.status.message:"Access Denied" OR
    protoPayload.status.message:"Permission denied" OR
    protoPayload.status.code=7
    ```
    
    Replace PROJECT\_ID with your project ID.

4.  In the query results, expand the log entry that corresponds to your failed operation.

5.  In the `  protoPayload  ` section, expand the `  authorizationInfo  ` array, and then expand each node in the `  authorizationInfo  ` array.
    
    The `  authorizationInfo  ` array shows every permission check performed during the API call.

6.  To see the cause of the error, look for the `  granted: false  ` entry. The `  granted: false  ` entry shows the following information:
    
      - `  permission  ` : The IAM permission string that was checked. For example, `  bigquery.tables.getData  ` .
      - `  resource  ` : The fully qualified name of the resource that the principal attempted to access. For example, `  projects/myproject/datasets/mydataset/tables/mytable  ` .
      - `  principalEmail  ` (if available): Referenced in `  protoPayload.authenticationInfo  ` , this is the principal that attempted the action.

**Note:** You can find additional BigQuery audit log sample queries on the Google Cloud Observability [**Sample queries** page](/logging/docs/view/query-library#bigquery-filters) .

## Use the Policy Analyzer for allow policies

Policy Analyzer for allow policies lets you find out which [IAM principals](/iam/docs/principals-overview) have what access to which BigQuery resources based on your [IAM allow policies](/iam/docs/policies) .

**Note:** Policy Intelligence also provides a [Policy Troubleshooter for IAM](/policy-intelligence/docs/troubleshoot-access) that lets you troubleshoot access for a specific principal.

After you gather information about the permissions error, you can use the Policy Analyzer to understand why the principal lacks the required access. This tool analyzes all relevant policies, memberships in Google Groups, and inheritance from parent resources such as a project, a folder, and your organization.

To use Policy Analyzer for allow policies, you create an analysis query, specify a scope for the analysis, and then run the query.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Policy Analyzer** page.
    
    Alternatively, from the navigation menu, choose **IAM & Admin \> Policy Analyzer** .

2.  Click **Create Custom Query** .

3.  On the **Configure your query** page, enter the information you gathered previously:
    
    1.  In the **Select the scope** section, in the **Select query scope** field, verify that your current project appears or click **Browse** to choose another resource.
    
    2.  In the **Set the query parameters** section, for **Parameter 1** , choose **Principal** , and in the **Principal** field, enter the email of the user, group, or service account.
    
    3.  Click add **Add parameter** .
    
    4.  For **Parameter 2** , choose **Permission** , and in the **Permission** field, click **Select** , choose the BigQuery permission, and then click **Add** . For example, select **`  bigquery.tables.getData  `** .
    
    5.  Click add **Add parameter** .
    
    6.  For **Parameter 3** , choose **Resource** , and in the **Resource** field, enter the fully qualified resource name. The resource name must include the service prefix as in the following examples:
        
          - **BigQuery project** : `  //cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_ID  `
          - **BigQuery dataset** : `  //bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT_ID /datasets/ DATASET  `
          - **BigQuery table** : `  //bigquery.googleapis.com/projects/ PROJECT /datasets/ DATASET /tables/ TABLE  `

4.  In the **Custom query** pane, click **Analyze \> Run query** .

5.  Examine the query results. The result can be one of the following:
    
      - **An empty list** . No results confirm that the principal doesn't have the required permission. You'll need to [grant the principal a role](#find-role) that provides the correct permissions.
      - **One or more results** . If the analyzer finds an allow policy, some form of access exists. Click **View Binding** on each result to view the roles that provide access to the resource that the principal is a member of. The policy binding shows whether access is granted through group membership or inheritance, or whether access is denied by an [IAM condition](/bigquery/docs/conditions) or an [IAM deny policy](/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam#deny_access_to_a_resource) .

## Find the correct IAM role that grants the required permissions

After you confirm that the principal doesn't have sufficient access, the next step is to find the appropriate predefined or custom IAM role that grants the required permissions. The role you choose should adhere to the principle of least privilege.

If your organization uses custom roles, you can find the correct role by [listing all custom roles created in your project or organization](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#roles-list) . For example, in the Google Cloud console, on the **Roles** page, you can filter the list by **Type:Custom** to see only custom roles.

To find the correct predefined IAM role, follow these steps.

1.  Open the [BigQuery permissions section](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bq-permissions) of the BigQuery IAM roles and permissions page.

2.  In the **Enter a permission** search bar, enter the permission you retrieved from the error message, job history, or audit logs. For example, `  bigquery.tables.getData  ` .
    
    The search results show all predefined BigQuery roles that grant the permission.

3.  Apply the principle of least privilege: in the list of roles, choose the least permissive role that grants the required permissions. For example, if you searched for `  bigquery.tables.getData  ` to grant the ability to query table data, [BigQuery Data Viewer](/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.dataViewer) is the least permissive role that grants that permission.

4.  Grant the principal the appropriate role. For information about how to grant an IAM role to a BigQuery resource, see [Control access to resources with IAM](/bigquery/docs/control-access-to-resources-iam) .
