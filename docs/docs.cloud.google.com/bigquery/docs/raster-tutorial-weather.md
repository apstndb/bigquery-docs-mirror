# Use raster data to analyze temperature

This tutorial describes how to perform geospatial analysis on [raster data](/bigquery/docs/raster-data) .

## Objectives

  - Find publicly available Google Earth Engine data in BigQuery sharing (formerly Analytics Hub).
  - Use the [`  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions#st_regionstats) to calculate the average temperature in each country at a point in time.
  - Visualize your results in [BigQuery Geo Viz](/bigquery/docs/geospatial-visualize) , which is a web tool for visualization of geospatial data in BigQuery using Google Maps APIs.

## Costs

In this tutorial, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:

  - [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing)
  - [Google Earth Engine](https://cloud.google.com/earth-engine/pricing)

## Before you begin

We recommend that you create a Google Cloud project for this tutorial. Make sure that you have the required roles to complete this tutorial.

### Set up a Google Cloud project

1.  Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads.

2.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
    
    **Roles required to select or create a project**
    
      - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
      - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

3.  [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

4.  Enable the BigQuery, BigQuery sharing, and Google Earth Engine APIs.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to perform the tasks in this tutorial, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on your project:

  - [Earth Engine Resource Viewer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/earthengine#earthengine.viewer) ( `  roles/earthengine.viewer  ` )
  - [Service Usage Consumer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/serviceusage#serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer) ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer  ` )
  - [BigQuery Data Editor](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataEditor) ( `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

These predefined roles contain the permissions required to perform the tasks in this tutorial. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to perform the tasks in this tutorial:

  - `  earthengine.computations.create  `
  - `  serviceusage.services.use  `
  - `  bigquery.datasets.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Subscribe to a dataset

To find the dataset used for this tutorial, follow these steps:

1.  Go to the **Sharing (Analytics Hub)** page.

2.  Click search **Search listings** .

3.  In the **Search for listings** field, enter `  "ERA5-Land Daily Aggregated"  ` .

4.  Click the result. A details pane opens with information about the ERA5-Land climate reanalysis dataset, including a description, a link to band information, the availability, the pixel size, and the terms of use.

5.  Click **Subscribe** .

6.  Optional: Update the **Project** .

7.  Update the **Linked dataset name** to `  era5_climate_tutorial  ` .

8.  Click **Save** . The linked dataset is added to your project and contains a single table called `  climate  ` .

## Find the raster ID

Each row in the `  era5_climate_tutorial.climate  ` table contains metadata for a raster image that has climate data for a particular day. Run the following query to extract the raster ID of the raster image for January 1, 2025:

``` text
SELECT
  assets.image.href
FROM
  `era5_climate_tutorial.climate`
WHERE
  properties.start_datetime = '2025-01-01';
```

The result is `  ee://ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/DAILY_AGGR/20250101  ` . In the next section, you use this for the `  raster_id  ` argument to the `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function.

## Compute the average temperature

Run the following query to compute the average temperature of each country on January 1, 2025 using the [`  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions#st_regionstats) :

``` text
WITH SimplifiedCountries AS (
  SELECT
    ST_SIMPLIFY(geometry, 10000) AS simplified_geometry,
    names.primary AS name
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.overture_maps.division_area`
  WHERE
    subtype = 'country'
)
SELECT
  sc.simplified_geometry AS geometry,
  sc.name,
  ST_REGIONSTATS(
    sc.simplified_geometry,
    'ee://ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/DAILY_AGGR/20250101',
    'temperature_2m'
  ).mean - 273.15 AS mean_temperature
FROM
  SimplifiedCountries AS sc
ORDER BY
  mean_temperature DESC;
```

This query runs on the publicly available `  division_area  ` table that contains `  GEOGRAPHY  ` values representing the boundaries of various regions on Earth, including countries. The `  ST_REGIONSTATS  ` function uses the `  temerature_2m  ` band of the raster image, which contains the temperature of the air at 2 meters above the surface of the land at the given pixel.

## Visualize the query results in BigQuery

To visualize your results in BigQuery, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Query results** pane, click the **Visualization** tab.

2.  For **Data column** , select `  mean_temperature  ` .
    
    A world map appears, styled by a color gradient for the average temperature of each country.

## Visualize the query results in Geo Viz

You can also visualize your results using BigQuery Geo Viz.

### Launch Geo Viz and authenticate

Before using Geo Viz, you must authenticate and grant access to data in BigQuery.

To set up Geo Viz, do the following:

1.  Open the Geo Viz web tool.
    
    Alternatively, in the **Query results** pane, click **Open in \> GeoViz** .

2.  In step one, **Query** , click **Authorize** .

3.  In the **Choose an account** dialog, click your Google Account.

4.  In the access dialog, click **Allow** to give Geo Viz access to your BigQuery data.

### Run your query in Geo Viz

After you authenticate and grant access, the next step is to run the query in Geo Viz.

To run the query, do the following:

1.  For step one, **Select data** , enter your project ID in the **Project ID** field.

2.  In the query window, enter the following GoogleSQL query. If you opened Geo Viz from your query results, this field is already populated with your query.
    
    ``` text
    WITH SimplifiedCountries AS (
      SELECT
        ST_SIMPLIFY(geometry, 10000) AS simplified_geometry,
        names.primary AS name
      FROM
        `bigquery-public-data.overture_maps.division_area`
      WHERE
        subtype = 'country'
    )
    SELECT
      sc.simplified_geometry AS geometry,
      sc.name,
      ST_REGIONSTATS(
        sc.simplified_geometry,
        'ee://ECMWF/ERA5_LAND/DAILY_AGGR/20250101',
        'temperature_2m'
      ).mean - 273.15 AS mean_temperature
    FROM
      SimplifiedCountries AS sc
    ORDER BY
      mean_temperature DESC;
    ```

3.  Click **Run** .

### Apply styles

The **Style** section provides a list of visual styles for customization. For more information about each style, see [Format your visualization](/bigquery/docs/geospatial-get-started#format_your_visualization) .

To format your map, do the following:

1.  To open the **fillColor** panel, click step 3, **Style** .

2.  Click the **Data-driven** toggle to the on position.

3.  For **Function** , choose **linear** .

4.  For **Field** , choose **`  mean_temperature  `** .

5.  For **Domain** , enter `  -20  ` in the first box and `  32  ` in the second box.

6.  For **Range** , click the first box and enter `  #0006ff  ` in the **Hex** box, and then click the second box and enter `  #ff0000  ` . This changes the color of each country based on its average temperature on January 1, 2025. Blue indicates a colder temperature and red indicates a warmer temperature.

7.  Click **fillOpacity** .

8.  In the **Value** field, enter `  .5  ` .

9.  Click **Apply style** .

10. Examine your map. If you click a country, the country's name, average temperature, and simplified geometry are displayed.

## Clean up

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `  appspot.com  ` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.
