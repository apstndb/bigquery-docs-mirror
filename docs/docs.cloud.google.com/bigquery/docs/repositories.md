## Before you begin

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to work with a repositories and workspaces, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on repositories and workspaces:

  - Create and manage shared repositories: [Code Owner](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.codeOwner) ( `  roles/dataform.codeOwner  ` )
  - Create and delete workspaces in shared repositories: [Code Editor](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.codeEditor) ( `  roles/dataform.codeEditor  ` )
  - Create, modify, and version control files in workspaces in shared repositories: [Code Editor](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.codeEditor) ( `  roles/dataform.codeEditor  ` )
  - View workspaces and their files in shared repositories: [Code Viewer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.codeViewer) ( `  roles/dataform.codeViewer  ` )
  - Create and manage private repositories, including all actions with workspaces and files in the private repository: [Code Creator](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/dataform#dataform.codeCreator) ( `  roles/dataform.codeCreator  ` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

Principals that have the Code Editor role on a repository are able to edit all workspaces in the repository.

Private repositories that you create are still visible to principals who are granted the BigQuery Admin or BigQuery Studio Admin roles at the project level. These principals can share your private repository with other users.

## Create a repository

To create a BigQuery repository, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and then click **Repositories** to open the **Repositories** tab in the details pane.

4.  Click **Add Repository** .

5.  In the **Create repository** pane, in the **Repository ID** field, type a unique ID.
    
    IDs can only include numbers, letters, hyphens, and underscores.

6.  In the **Region** drop-down list, select a BigQuery region for storing the repository and its contents. Select the BigQuery region nearest to your location.
    
    For a list of available BigQuery regions, see [BigQuery Studio locations](/bigquery/docs/locations#bqstudio-loc) . The repository region does not have to match the location of your BigQuery datasets.

7.  Click **Create** .

## Connect to a third-party repository

This section shows you how to connect a BigQuery repository to a remote repository. After you connect the repositories, you can perform Git actions on the files in the workspaces contained by the repository. For example, pulling updates from the remote repository and pushing changes to the remote repository.

We recommend creating a dedicated BigQuery repository for each remote repository that you connect to. Give the BigQuery repository a similar name to the remote repository to help make the mapping clear.

You can connect a remote repository through HTTPS or SSH. Connecting a BigQuery repository to a remote repository can fail if the remote repository is not open to the public internet, for example, if it is behind a firewall. The following table lists supported Git providers and the connection methods that are available for their repositories:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Git provider</th>
<th>Connection method</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Azure DevOps Services</td>
<td>SSH</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Bitbucket</td>
<td>SSH</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>GitHub</td>
<td>SSH or HTTPS</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>GitLab</td>
<td>SSH or HTTPS</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Important:** To create a BigQuery repository connected to a remote Git repository that is not allow-listed in the `  dataform.restrictGitRemotes  ` policy, first add the remote Git repository to the `  allowedValues  ` list in the policy, and then create a new BigQuery repository and connect it to the remote repository. For more information, see [Restrict remote repositories](/dataform/docs/restrict-git-remotes) .

### Connect a remote repository through SSH

To connect a remote repository through SSH, you must generate an SSH key and a Secret Manager secret. The SSH key consists of a public SSH key and a private SSH key. You must share the public SSH key with your Git provider, and create a Secret Manager secret with the private SSH key. Then, share the secret with your default BigQuery service account.

BigQuery uses the secret with the private SSH key to sign in to your Git provider to commit changes on behalf of users. BigQuery makes these commits using the user's Google Cloud email address so you can tell who made each commit.

**Warning:** The private SSH key that you create is shared among all BigQuery users who use the repository. We recommend that you create a machine user with your Git provider and limit its access to the remote Git repositories you plan to use with BigQuery. Only Google Cloud project owners and BigQuery users with the [Code Owner](/bigquery/docs/access-control) role can use the key to connect repositories. BigQuery users are not able to see the key itself.

To connect a remote repository to a BigQuery repository through SSH, follow these steps:

1.  In your Git provider, do the following:
    
    ### Azure DevOps Services
    
    1.  In Azure DevOps Services, [create a private SSH key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops#step-1-create-your-ssh-keys) .
    2.  [Upload the public SSH key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops#step-2-add-the-public-key-to-azure-devops) to your Azure DevOps Services repository.

2.  In Secret Manager, [create a secret](/secret-manager/docs/creating-and-accessing-secrets#create) and paste in your private SSH key as the secret value. Your private SSH key should be stored in a file similar to `  ~/.ssh/id_ed25519  ` . Give a name to the secret so you can find it in the future.

3.  [Grant access to the secret to your default Dataform service agent](/secret-manager/docs/manage-access-to-secrets) .
    
    Your default Dataform service account is in the following format:
    
    ``` text
    service-PROJECT_NUMBER@gcp-sa-dataform.iam.gserviceaccount.com
    ```

4.  Grant the [`  roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor  ` role](/secret-manager/docs/access-control#secretmanager.secretAccessor) to the service account.

5.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

6.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

16. Click **Connect** .

### Connect a remote repository through HTTPS

To connect a remote repository through HTTPS, you must create a Secret Manager secret with a personal access token, and share the secret with your default BigQuery service account.

BigQuery then uses the access token to sign in to your Git provider to commit changes on behalf of users. BigQuery makes these commits using the user's Google Cloud email address so you can tell who made each commit.

**Warning:** The private HTTPS token that you create is shared among all BigQuery users who use the repository. We recommend that you create a machine user with your Git provider and limit its access to the remote Git repositories you plan to use with BigQuery. Only Google Cloud project owners and BigQuery users with the [Code Owner](/bigquery/docs/access-control) role can use the token to connect repositories. BigQuery users are not able to see the token itself.

To connect a remote repository to a BigQuery repository through HTTPS, follow these steps:

1.  In your Git provider, do the following:
    
    ### GitHub
    
    1.  In GitHub, create a [fine-grained personal access token](https://github.blog/2022-10-18-introducing-fine-grained-personal-access-tokens-for-github/) or a [classic personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#about-personal-access-tokens) .
        
          - For a fine-grained GitHub personal access token, do the following:
        
        <!-- end list -->
        
        1.  Select repository access to only selected repositories, then select the repository that you want to connect to.
        
        2.  Grant read and write access on contents of the repository.
        
        3.  Set a token expiration time appropriate to your needs.
        
        <!-- end list -->
        
          - For a classic GitHub personal access token, do the following:
        
        <!-- end list -->
        
        1.  Grant BigQuery the `  repo  ` permission.
        
        2.  Set a token expiration time appropriate to your needs.
    
    2.  If your organization uses SAML single sign-on (SSO), [authorize the token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) .
    
    ### GitLab
    
    1.  In GitLab, create a [GitLab personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) .
