# Write queries with Gemini assistance

This document describes how to use AI-powered assistance in [Gemini in BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/gemini-overview) to help you query your data with SQL queries and Python code. Gemini in BigQuery can generate and explain queries and code, complete queries and code while you type, and fix code errors.

To follow step-by-step guidance for this task directly in the Google Cloud console, click **Guide me** :

Gemini for Google Cloud doesn't use your prompts or its responses as data to train its models without your express permission. For more information about how Google uses your data, see [How Gemini for Google Cloud uses your data](/gemini/docs/discover/data-governance) .

**Note:** To opt in to data sharing for Gemini in BigQuery features in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) , see [Help improve suggestions](/bigquery/docs/write-sql-gemini#help_improve_suggestions_2) .

Only English language prompts are supported for Gemini in BigQuery.

This document is intended for data analysts, data scientists, and data developers who work with SQL queries and [Colab Enterprise notebooks in BigQuery](/bigquery/docs/notebooks-introduction) . It assumes that you know how to query data in the BigQuery Studio environment or how to work with Python notebooks to analyze BigQuery data.

## Before you begin

1.  Ensure that [Gemini in BigQuery is set up for your Google Cloud project](/bigquery/docs/gemini-set-up) . This step is normally done by an administrator. Gemini in BigQuery features might be turned off or unavailable until you complete the remaining steps in this section.

2.  To use [Gemini Cloud Assist](/cloud-assist/overview) , to write code in the Gemini Cloud Assist pane, you must also follow the steps in [Set up Gemini Cloud Assist](/cloud-assist/set-up-gemini) .

3.  To use Gemini to explain and fix Python code in your Colab Enterprise notebooks in BigQuery, you must also follow the steps in [Set up Gemini in Colab Enterprise for a project](/colab/docs/gemini-in-colab/set-up-gemini) .

4.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
    
    **Roles required to select or create a project**
    
      - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
      - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

5.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery Studio** page.

6.  In the BigQuery toolbar, click pen\_spark arrow\_drop\_down **Gemini** .

7.  In the list of features, ensure the following features are selected:
    
      - **Gemini in SQL query** list:
        
          - **Auto-completion** (Preview). As you type in the query editor, Gemini can suggest logical next steps that are relevant to your current query's context, or it can help you iterate on a query.
          - **Auto-generation** . You can prompt Gemini in BigQuery using a natural language comment in the BigQuery query editor to generate a SQL query.
          - **SQL generation tool** . You can enter natural language text in a tool to generate a SQL query, with options to refine query results, choose table sources, and compare results.
          - **Explanation** . You can prompt Gemini in BigQuery to explain a SQL query using natural language.
    
      - **Gemini in Python notebook** list:
        
          - **Code completion** (Preview). Gemini provides contextually appropriate recommendations that are based on content in the notebook.
          - **Code generation** . You can prompt Gemini using a natural language statement or question to generate Python code.

8.  To complete the tasks in this document, ensure that you have the [required Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions](#required_permissions) .

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to write queries with Gemini assistance, ask your administrator to grant you the [Gemini for Google Cloud User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudaicompanion#cloudaicompanion.user) ( `  roles/cloudaicompanion.user  ` ) IAM role on the project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to write queries with Gemini assistance. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to write queries with Gemini assistance:

  - `  cloudaicompanion.entitlements.get  `
  - `  cloudaicompanion.instances.completeTask  `
  - Explain SQL queries: `  cloudaicompanion.companions.generateChat  `
  - Complete SQL or Python code: `  cloudaicompanion.instances.completeCode  `
  - Generate SQL or Python code: `  cloudaicompanion.instances.generateCode  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information about IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see [Introduction to IAM](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

## Generate a SQL query

As an early-stage technology, Gemini for Google Cloud products can generate output that seems plausible but is factually incorrect. We recommend that you validate all output from Gemini for Google Cloud products before you use it. For more information, see [Gemini for Google Cloud and responsible AI](/gemini/docs/discover/responsible-ai) .

To generate a SQL query based on your data's schema, you can provide Gemini in BigQuery with a natural language statement or question, also known as a *prompt* . You can also browse prompt recommendations from Gemini. Even if you're starting with no code, a limited knowledge of the data schema, or only a basic knowledge of GoogleSQL syntax, Gemini in BigQuery can generate SQL that can help you explore your data.

### Use the SQL generation tool

The SQL generation tool lets you use natural language to generate a SQL query about your recently viewed or queried tables. You can also use the tool to modify an existing query, and to manually specify the tables for which you want to generate SQL.

To use the SQL generation tool, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery Studio** page.

2.  Next to the query editor, click pen\_spark **SQL generation tool** .

3.  In the **Generate SQL with Gemini** dialog, you have the following options:
    
      - Enter a natural language prompt about a table that you recently viewed or queried. For example, if you recently viewed [`  bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips  ` table](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2saustin_bikeshare!3sbikeshare_trips) , you might enter the following:
        
        ``` text
        Show me the duration and subscriber type for the ten longest trips.
        ```
    
      - Click one of the Gemini recommended prompts ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) ). The prompt is copied to the **Generate SQL with Gemini** dialog.

4.  Click **Generate** .
    
    The generated SQL query is similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
        subscriber_type,
        duration_sec
      FROM
          `bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
    ORDER BY
        duration_sec DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```
    
    **Note:** Gemini in BigQuery might suggest different syntax each time that you enter the same prompt.

5.  Review the generated SQL query and take any of the following actions:
    
      - To accept the generated SQL query, click **Insert** to insert the statement into the query editor. You can then click **Run** to execute the suggested SQL query.
      - To edit your prompt, click **Edit** and then modify or replace your initial prompt. After you've edited your prompt, click **Update** to generate a new query.
      - To update the table sources that were used as context to generate the suggested SQL query, click **Edit Table Sources** , select the appropriate checkboxes, and then click **Apply** .
      - To view a natural language summary of the generated query, click **Query Summary** .
      - To refine the suggested SQL query, enter any refinements in the **Refine** field, and then click send **Refine** . For example, enter `  limit to 1000  ` to limit the number of query results. To compare the changes to your query, select the **Show diff** checkbox.
      - To dismiss a suggested query, close the SQL generation tool.

#### Turn off the SQL generation tool

To learn how to turn off the SQL generation tool, see [Turn off Gemini query assistant features](#disable-gemini-features) .

### Generate SQL from a comment

You can generate SQL in the query editor by describing the query that you want in a comment.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery Studio** page.

2.  In the query editor, click add\_box **SQL query** .

3.  In the query editor, write a SQL comment about a table you have recently viewed or queried. For example, if you recently viewed the [`  bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips  ` table](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2saustin_bikeshare!3sbikeshare_trips) , then you might write the following comment:
    
    ``` text
    # Show me the duration and subscriber type for the ten longest trips.
    ```

4.  Press Enter ( Return on macOS).
    
    The suggested SQL query is similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    # Show me the duration and subscriber type for the ten longest trips
    
    SELECT
      duration_sec,
      subscriber_type
      AVG(duration_minutes) AS average_trip_length
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips`
    ORDER BY
      duration_sec
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

5.  To accept the suggestion, press Tab .

          - **Accept and run** : accept the changes and run the query.
          - **Accept** : accept the changes.
          - **Decline** : close the comparison pane without making changes to your existing query.
    
      - To replace the contents of the query editor with the generated query and run it, click **Apply and run** .

### Tips for SQL generation

The following tips can improve suggestions that Gemini in BigQuery provides:

  - To manually specify which tables to use, you can include the fully qualified table name in backticks ( ``  `  `` ), such as ``  ` PROJECT . DATASET . TABLE `  `` .
  - If the column names or their semantic relationships are unclear or complex, then you can provide context in the prompt to guide Gemini towards the answer that you want. For example, to encourage a generated query to reference a column name, describe the column name and its relevance to the answer that you want. To encourage an answer that references complex terms like *lifetime value* or *gross margin* , describe the concept and its relevance to your data to improve SQL generation results.
  - When you generate SQL from a comment, you can format your prompt over multiple lines by prefixing each line with the `  #  ` character.
  - Column descriptions are considered when you generate SQL queries. To improve accuracy, add column descriptions to your schema. For more information about column descriptions, see [Column descriptions](/bigquery/docs/schemas#column_descriptions) in "Specify a schema."

### Convert comments to SQL

**Preview**

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) . Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

**Note:** To request support or provide feedback for this feature, send email to <gemini-in-bigquery-feedback@google.com> .

You can use comments as prompts to create SQL queries that help you explore your data in BigQuery. You can embed comments containing natural language prompts that describe the information that you want from your data. Gemini responds with SQL that you can then compare or insert into your query. Natural language expressions can help you iterate on and transform your SQL code. Natural language expressions can also help with SQL syntax such as timestamps and window functions.

To use natural language SQL generation, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the **BigQuery Studio** query editor, click pen\_spark and ensure Gemini SQL **Auto-generation** is enabled.

3.  In the BigQuery query editor, enter a SQL query containing a natural language prompt enclosed in a comment in the format of `  /* natural language text */  ` about a table that you recently viewed or queried. Gemini in BigQuery uses the metadata of recently queried tables in an effort to find appropriate data, so you can help guide responses by querying a table. For best results, your natural language prompt should be specific to SQL syntax and your data, and not a general expression such as "optimize my query."
    
    For example, if you recently queried [`  bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips  ` table](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1sbigquery-public-data!2saustin_bikeshare!3sbikeshare_trips) , you might enter the following:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
        subscriber_type,
        /* the name of the day of week of the trip start ordered longest to
         shortest trip with the trip's duration */
    FROM
        `bigquery-public-data`.`austin_bikeshare`.`bikeshare_trips`
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

4.  Highlight the SQL query, including the natural language expression, that you want Gemini to convert. In the previous example, you would highlight the entire SQL sample.

5.  To generate SQL code, in the margin or the query editor you can click auto\_awesome **Gemini** , and then click pen\_spark **Convert comments to SQL** .

6.  Review the generated SQL. The **Transform SQL with Gemini** output shows the difference between the original text and the generated text. The generated SQL query should be similar to the following:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      subscriber_type,
      FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%A', start_time) AS day_of_week,
      duration_minutes
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data`.`austin_bikeshare`.`bikeshare_trips`
    ORDER BY
      duration_minutes DESC
    LIMIT
      10;
    ```

7.  To copy the query to the query editor, click **Insert** . Your previous statement, including your natural language prompt, appears in comments and the generated SQL code is copied to the edit pane where you can run or edit it. You can also select one of the following:
    
      - **Refine** : to prompt Gemini to modify the generated SQL
      - **Edit Table Sources** : to select a different table
      - **Query Summary** : to have Gemini provide a summary of the SQL query.

You can ask Gemini Code Assist to generate PySpark code in your notebook. Gemini Code Assist fetches and uses relevant BigQuery and Dataproc Metastore tables and their schemas to generate a code response. With its schema knowledge, Gemini Code Assist avoids hallucinations, and suggests join keys and column types.

To generate Gemini Code Assist code in your notebook, do the following:

1.  Insert a new code cell by clicking **+ Code** in the toolbar. The new code cell displays `  Start coding or generate with AI  ` . Click **generate** .

2.  In the Generate editor, enter a natural language prompt, and then click `  enter  ` . **Make sure to include the keyword `  spark  ` or `  pyspark  ` in your prompt.** .
    
    Sample prompt:
    
    ``` text
    create a spark dataframe from order_items and filter to orders created in 2024
    ```
    
    Sample output:
    
    ``` text
    spark.read.format("bigquery").option("table", "sqlgen-testing.pysparkeval_ecommerce.order_items").load().filter("year(created_at) = 2024").createOrReplaceTempView("order_items")
    df = spark.sql("SELECT * FROM order_items")
    ```

### Tips for Gemini Code Assist code generation

  - To let Gemini Code Assist fetch relevant tables and schemas, turn on [Data Catalog sync](/dataproc-metastore/docs/data-catalog-sync) for Dataproc Metastore instances.

  - Make sure your user account has access to Data Catalog to query tables. To do this, assign the [`  DataCatalog.Viewer  ` role](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/datacatalog#datacatalog.viewer) .
