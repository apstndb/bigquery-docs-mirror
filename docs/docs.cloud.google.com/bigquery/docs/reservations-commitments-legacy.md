# Purchase and manage legacy slot commitments

**Note:** Legacy reservations, including access to flat-rate billing or certain commitment lengths, are only available to allow-listed customers. To determine if you have access to these legacy features, contact your administrator. The flat-rate billing model defines how you are billed for compute, but flat-rate reservations and commitments function as Enterprise edition slots.

The BigQuery Reservation API lets you purchase dedicated slots (called [*commitments*](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) ), create pools of slots (called [*reservations*](/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro#reservations) ), and assign projects, folders, and organizations to those reservations.

A *capacity commitment* is a purchase of BigQuery compute capacity for some minimum duration of time. Purchasing a capacity commitment is optional when creating a reservation with an [edition](/bigquery/docs/editions-intro) , but can provide cost savings.

Commitments are a regional resource. Commitments purchased in one region or multi-region cannot be used in any other regions or multi-regions. Commitments cannot be moved between regions or between regions and multi-regions.

## Enable the Reservations API

The BigQuery Reservation API is distinct from the existing BigQuery API and must be enabled independently. For more information, see [Enabling and disabling APIs](/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis) .

  - The name of the API is "BigQuery Reservations API"
  - The endpoint for the BigQuery Reservation API is `  bigqueryreservation.googleapis.com  ` .

**Note:** If you want to prevent anyone in your organization from enabling the BigQuery Reservation API, [contact support](/support) .

## Purchase slots

To reserve capacity for some minimum amount of time, you can purchase a [capacity commitment](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) . This provides a discount and saves on costs. For more information about the specific costs, see [BigQuery pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#capacity_compute_analysis_pricing) .

### Required permissions

To create a capacity commitment, you need the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission:

  - `  bigquery.capacityCommitments.create  ` on the [administration project](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#admin-project) that maintains ownership of the commitments.

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes this permission:

  - `  BigQuery Admin  `
  - `  BigQuery Resource Admin  `

For more information about IAM roles in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

### Create a capacity commitment

**Caution:** Before creating a capacity commitment, understand the details of the [commitment plans](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) and [pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#capacity_compute_analysis_pricing) .

Commitments are a regional resource. Commitments purchased in one region or multi-region cannot be used in any other regions or multi-regions. Commitments cannot be moved between regions or between regions and multi-regions.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Capacity management** .

3.  Click **Create Commitment** .

4.  Under **Configure** :
    
    1.  Select the location.
    
    2.  In the **Capacity model** section, select the capacity model.
    
    3.  Select the **Commitment duration** , which specifies your commitment plan.
    
    4.  If you are purchasing an **Annual** commitment, select the **Renewal plan that you want to take effect when the commitment expires** :
        
        1.  **Do not renew and convert to a monthly commitment** (Default). When the annual commitment expires, it converts to a monthly commitment.
        2.  **Renew annually** . When the annual commitment expires, it renews for another year as an annual commitment.
        3.  **Do not renew and convert to flex slots** . When the annual commitment expires, it converts to a flex slots commitment.
        
        For more information, see [Slot commitments](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) .
    
    5.  Enter the **Number of slots** you want to purchase.
    
    6.  Click **Next** .

5.  Review the **Cost** estimate for your purchase.

6.  Under **Confirm and submit** :
    
    1.  Type CONFIRM to confirm the purchase.
    2.  Click **Purchase** to purchase the slots.

7.  To view the commitment, click **View slot commitments** . After the capacity is provisioned, the requested capacity commitment has a green status.
    
    **Note:** Slots are usually provisioned quickly, but in rare cases it can take several hours. If you have a critical workload where you expect to have increased demand, reserve your slots at least one day in advance.

The first time you purchase capacity, a `  default  ` reservation is created.

### SQL

  - `  COMMITMENT_ID  ` : the ID of the commitment
    
    To get the ID, see [View purchased commitments](#view-commitments) .

### Convert a commitment to longer duration

You can choose to convert your commitment to a longer-duration commitment type at any time:

  - You can convert your flex slots commitment to a monthly or annual commitment.
  - You can convert your monthly commitment to an annual commitment.

As soon as you update your commitment, you are charged the rate associated with the new plan, and the end date resets.

To convert a commitment, use the [`  bq update  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_update) with the [`  --plan  ` flag](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#update-plan-flag) .

``` text
bq update \

```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID

  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the commitment

  - `  PLAN_TYPE  ` : the [plan type](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) , such as `  FLEX  ` , `  MONTHLY  ` , or `  ANNUAL  ` .

  - `  RENEWAL_PLAN  ` : the [renewal](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#renew-commitments) plan
    
    This applies only if the `  PLAN_TYPE  ` is `  ANNUAL  ` . If the `  PLAN_TYPE  ` is `  MONTHLY  ` , omit this flag.

  - `  COMMITMENT_ID  ` : the ID of the commitment
    
    To get the ID, see [View purchased commitments](#view-commitments) .

### Split a commitment

You can split your commitment into two commitments. This can be useful if you want to [renew](#renewing-commitments) part of a commitment. For example, if you have an annual commitment of 1,000 slots, you could split off 300 slots into a new commitment, leaving 700 slots in the original commitment. You could then renew 700 slots at the annual rate, and convert 300 slots to flex slots after the end date.

When you split a commitment, the new commitment has the same plan and the same commitment end date as the original commitment.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Capacity management** .

3.  Click the **Slot commitments** tab.

4.  Select the commitment that you want to split.

5.  Click **Split** .

6.  In the **Split commitment** page, use the **Configure split** slider to select how many slots go into each split, in increments of 100 slots.

7.  Click **Split** to split the commitment. The new commitment is listed in the **Slot commitments** tab.

### bq

To split commitments, use the `  bq update  ` command.

``` text
bq update \
    --project_id=ADMIN_PROJECT_ID \
    --location=LOCATION \
    --split \
    --slots=SLOTS_TO_SPLIT \
    --capacity_commitment=true \
    COMMITMENT_ID
```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID

  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the commitment

  - `  SLOTS_TO_SPLIT  ` : the number of slots to split from the original commitment into a new commitment

  - `  COMMITMENT_ID  ` : the ID of the commitment
    
    To get the ID, see [View purchased commitments](#view-commitments) .

### Merge two commitments

You can merge multiple commitments into one commitment. The merging commitments must all be of the same type ( `  FLEX  ` , `  MONTHLY  ` , `  ANNUAL  ` , or `  THREE_YEAR  ` ). The end date of the combined commitment is the maximum end date of the original commitments. If any of the commitments have an earlier end date, they are extended to the later date and you are charged a prorated amount for those slots.

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Capacity management** .

3.  Click the **Slot commitments** tab.

4.  Select the commitments that you want to merge.

5.  Click **Merge** .

6.  In the **Merge commitments** page, review the details of the merge and click **Merge** . The new merged commitment is listed in the **Slot commitments** tab.

### bq

To merge two commitments into one commitment, use the `  bq update  ` command:

``` text
bq update \
    --project_id=ADMIN_PROJECT_ID \
    --location=LOCATION \
    --merge=true \
    --capacity_commitment=true \
    COMMITMENT1,COMMITMENT2
```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the commitments
  - `  COMMITMENT1  ` : the first commitment to merge
  - `  COMMITMENT2  ` : the second commitment to merge

## Delete a commitment

You can delete a capacity commitment if its end date is in the past. The commitment end date is shown in the Google Cloud console. Before you delete a commitment, make sure there are enough unallocated slots. If not, you must decrease the number of slots in a reservation or remove reservations entirely.

### Required permissions

To delete capacity commitments, you need the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission:

  - `  bigquery.capacityCommitments.delete  ` on the [administration project](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#admin-project) that maintains ownership of the commitments.

    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project that owns the commitment
    
      - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the commitment
    
      - `  COMMITMENT_ID  ` : the ID of the commitment
        
        To get the ID, see [View purchased commitments](#view-commitments) .

## Troubleshooting capacity commitments

This section describes troubleshooting steps that you might find helpful if you run into problems using BigQuery Reservations.

### Purchased slots are pending

Slots are subject to available capacity. When you purchase slot commitments and BigQuery allocates them, then the **Status** column shows a check mark. If BigQuery can't allocate the requested slots immediately, then the **Status** column remains pending. You might have to wait several hours for the slots to become available. If you need access to slots sooner, try the following:

1.  Delete the pending commitment.
2.  Purchase a new commitment for a smaller number of slots. Depending on capacity, the smaller commitment might become active immediately.
3.  Purchase the remaining slots as a separate commitment. These slots might show as pending in the **Status** column, but they generally become active within a few hours.
4.  Optional: When both commitments are available, you can [merge](#merging-commitments) them into a single commitment, as long as you purchased the same plan for both.

If a slot commitment fails or takes a long time to complete, consider using [on-demand pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#on_demand_pricing) temporarily. With this solution, you might need to run critical queries on a different project that's not assigned to any reservations, or you might need to remove the project assignment altogether.
