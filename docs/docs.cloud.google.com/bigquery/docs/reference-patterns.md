# Reference patterns

This page provides links to business use cases, sample code, and technical reference guides for BigQuery ML use cases. Use these resources to identify best practices and speed up your application development.

## Logistic regression

This pattern shows how to use logistic regression to perform propensity modeling for gaming applications.

Learn how to use BigQuery ML to train, evaluate, and get predictions from several different types of propensity models. Propensity models can help you to determine the likelihood of specific users returning to your app, so you can use that information in marketing decisions.
