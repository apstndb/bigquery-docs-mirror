# Analyze object tables by using remote functions

This document describes how to analyze unstructured data in [object tables](/bigquery/docs/object-table-introduction) by using [remote functions](/bigquery/docs/remote-functions) .

## Overview

You can analyze the unstructured data represented by an object table by using a remote function. A remote function lets you call a function running on Cloud Run functions or Cloud Run, which you can program to access resources such as:

  - Google's pre-trained AI models, including Cloud Vision API and Document AI.
  - Open source libraries such as [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) .
  - Your own custom models.

To analyze object table data by using a remote function, you must generate and pass in [signed URLs](/bigquery/docs/object-table-introduction#signed_urls) for the objects in the object table when you call the remote function. These signed URLs are what grant the remote function access to the objects.

## Required permissions

  - To create the connection resource used by the remote function, you need the following permissions:
    
      - `  bigquery.connections.create  `
      - `  bigquery.connections.get  `
      - `  bigquery.connections.list  `
      - `  bigquery.connections.update  `
      - `  bigquery.connections.use  `
      - `  bigquery.connections.delete  `

  - To create a remote function, you need the permissions associated with the [Cloud Functions Developer](/functions/docs/reference/iam/roles#cloudfunctions.developer) or [Cloud Run Developer](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/run#run.developer) roles.

  - To invoke a remote function, you need the permissions described in [Remote functions](/bigquery/docs/remote-functions#grant_permission_on_function) .

  - To analyze an object table with a remote function, you need the `  bigquery.tables.getData  ` permission on the object table.

## Before you begin

1.  Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, [create an account](https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial) to evaluate how our products perform in real-world scenarios. New customers also get $300 in free credits to run, test, and deploy workloads.

2.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
    
    **Roles required to select or create a project**
    
      - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
      - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

3.  [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

4.  Enable the BigQuery, BigQuery Connection API, Cloud Run functions APIs.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

5.  In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
    
    **Roles required to select or create a project**
    
      - **Select a project** : Selecting a project doesn't require a specific IAM role—you can select any project that you've been granted a role on.
      - **Create a project** : To create a project, you need the Project Creator role ( `  roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator  ` ), which contains the `  resourcemanager.projects.create  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .
    
    **Note** : If you don't plan to keep the resources that you create in this procedure, create a project instead of selecting an existing project. After you finish these steps, you can delete the project, removing all resources associated with the project.

7.  Enable the BigQuery, BigQuery Connection API, Cloud Run functions APIs.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

8.  Ensure that your BigQuery administrator has [created a connection](/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection#create-cloud-resource-connection) and [set up access to Cloud Storage](/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection#access-storage) .

## Create a remote function

For general instructions on creating a remote function, see [Working with remote functions](/bigquery/docs/remote-functions) .

When you create a remote function to analyze object table data, you must pass in [signed URLS](/bigquery/docs/object-table-introduction#signed_urls) that have been generated for the objects in the object table. You can do this by using an input parameter with a `  STRING  ` data type. The signed URLS are made available to the remote function as input data in the [`  calls  ` field of the HTTP `  POST  ` request](/bigquery/docs/remote-functions#input_format) . An example of a request is:

``` text
{
  // Other fields omitted.
  "calls": [
    ["https://storage.googleapis.com/mybucket/1.pdf?X-Goog-SignedHeaders=abcd"],
    ["https://storage.googleapis.com/mybucket/2.pdf?X-Goog-SignedHeaders=wxyz"]
  ]
}
```

You can read an object in your remote function by using a method that makes an HTTP `  GET  ` request to the signed URL. The remote function can access the object because the signed URL contains authentication information in its query string.

When you specify the [`  CREATE FUNCTION  ` statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_function_statement) for the remote function, we recommend that you set the `  max_batching_rows  ` option to 1 in order to [avoid Cloud Run functions timeout](/functions/docs/concepts/exec#timeout) and increase processing parallelism.

### Example

The following Cloud Run functions Python code example reads storage objects and returns their content length to BigQuery:

``` text
import functions_framework
import json
import urllib.request

@functions_framework.http
def object_length(request):
  calls = request.get_json()['calls']
  replies = []
  for call in calls:
    object_content = urllib.request.urlopen(call[0]).read()
    replies.append(len(object_content))
  return json.dumps({'replies': replies})
```

Deployed, this function would have an endpoint similar to `  https://us-central1-myproject.cloudfunctions.net/object_length  ` .

The following example shows how to create a BigQuery remote function based on this Cloud Run functions function:

``` text
CREATE FUNCTION mydataset.object_length(signed_url STRING) RETURNS INT64
REMOTE WITH CONNECTION `us.myconnection`
OPTIONS(
  endpoint = "https://us-central1-myproject.cloudfunctions.net/object_length",
  max_batching_rows = 1
);
```

For step-by-step guidance, see [Tutorial: Analyze an object table with a remote function](/bigquery/docs/remote-function-tutorial) .

## Call a remote function

To call a remote function on object table data, reference the remote function in the [`  select_list  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#select_list) of the query, and then call the [`  EXTERNAL_OBJECT_TRANSFORM  ` function](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/table-functions-built-in#external_object_transform) in the [`  FROM  ` clause](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#from_clause) to generate the signed URLs for the objects.

**Note:** When using one of the [AI APIs](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai) , be aware of the relevant quotas for the API you are targeting. Use a `  LIMIT  ` clause to limit the results returned if necessary to stay within quota.

The following example shows typical statement syntax:

``` text
SELECT uri, function_name(signed_url) AS function_output
FROM EXTERNAL_OBJECT_TRANSFORM(TABLE my_dataset.object_table, ["SIGNED_URL"])
LIMIT 10000;
```

The following example shows how to process only a subset of the object table contents with a remote function:

``` text
SELECT uri, function_name(signed_url) AS function_output
FROM EXTERNAL_OBJECT_TRANSFORM(TABLE my_dataset.object_table, ["SIGNED_URL"])
WHERE content_type = "application/pdf";
```
