# Load Klaviyo data into BigQuery

**Preview**

This feature is subject to the "Pre-GA Offerings Terms" in the General Service Terms section of the [Service Specific Terms](/terms/service-terms#1) . Pre-GA features are available "as is" and might have limited support. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages) .

**Note:** To get support or provide feedback for this feature, contact <dts-preview-support@google.com> .

You can load data from Klaviyo to BigQuery using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Klaviyo connector. With the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, you can schedule recurring transfer jobs that add your latest data from Klaviyo to BigQuery.

## Before you begin

The following sections describe the prerequisites that you need to do before you create a Klaviyo data transfer.

### Klaviyo prerequisites

You must have a read-only private API key to allow the Klaviyo connector to transfer data to BigQuery. For more information, see [Create a private key](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/docs/authenticate_#create-a-private-key) .

### BigQuery prerequisites

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store your data.

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer:

  - BigQuery Data Transfer Service permissions:
      - `  bigquery.transfers.update  `
      - `  bigquery.transfers.get  `
  - BigQuery permissions:
      - `  bigquery.datasets.get  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.update  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information, see [Grant `  bigquery.admin  ` access](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service#grant_bigqueryadmin_access) .

If you intend to set up transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, ensure that you have the `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` IAM permission. Pub/Sub permissions aren't required if you only set up email notifications. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

## Set up a Klaviyo data transfer

Add Klaviyo data into BigQuery by setting up a transfer configuration using one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the Data transfers page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  Click add **Create transfer** .

3.  In the **Source type** section, for **Source** , choose **Klaviyo - Preview** .

4.  In the **Data source details** section, do the following:
    
      - For **Private API Key** , enter your private API key. For more information, see [Klaviyo prerequisites](/bigquery/docs/klaviyo-transfer#klaviyo-prerequisites) .
      - Optional: For **Start Date** , specify a start date for new records to be included in the data transfer. Only records created on or after this date are included in the data transfer. The default value is 3 months before the transfer run date.
      - For **Klaviyo objects to transfer** , click **Browse** to select any objects to be transferred to the BigQuery destination dataset. You can also manually enter any objects to include in the data transfer in this field.

5.  In the **Destination settings** section, for **Dataset** , choose the dataset that you created to store your data.

6.  In the **Transfer config name** section, for **Display name** , enter a name for the data transfer.

7.  In the **Schedule options** section:
    
      - In the **Repeat frequency** list, select an option to specify how often this data transfer runs. To specify a custom repeat frequency, select **Custom** . If you select **On-demand** , then this transfer runs when you [manually trigger the transfer](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .
      - If applicable, select either **Start now** or **Start at set time** , and provide a start date and run time.

8.  Optional: In the **Notification options** section, do the following:
    
      - To enable email notifications, click the **Email notification** toggle. When you enable this option, the transfer administrator receives an email notification when a transfer run fails.
      - To enable [Pub/Sub transfer run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) for this transfer, click the **Pub/Sub notifications** toggle. You can select your [topic](/pubsub/docs/publish-message-overview) name, or you can click **Create a topic** to create one.

9.  Click **Save** .

### bq

Enter the [`  bq mk  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_mk) and supply the transfer creation flag `  --transfer_config  ` :

``` text
bq mk
    --transfer_config
    --project_id=PROJECT_ID
    --data_source=DATA_SOURCE
    --display_name=NAME
    --target_dataset=DATASET
    --params='PARAMETERS'
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` (optional): your Google Cloud project ID. If `  --project_id  ` isn't supplied to specify a particular project, the default project is used.

  - `  DATA_SOURCE  ` : the data source — `  klaviyo  ` .

  - `  NAME  ` : the display name for the data transfer configuration. The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.

  - `  DATASET  ` : the target dataset for the transfer configuration.

  - `  PARAMETERS  ` : the parameters for the created transfer configuration in JSON format. For example: `  --params='{"param":"param_value"}'  ` . The following are the parameters for a Klaviyo data transfer:
    
      - `  assets  ` : the path to the Klaviyo objects to be transferred to BigQuery.
      - `  connector.authentication.privateApiKey  ` : the private API key for the Klaviyo account.
      - `  connector.startDate  ` : (Optional) a start date for new records to be included in the data transfer, in the format `  YYYY-MM-DD  ` . Only records created on or after this date are included in the data transfer. The default value is 3 months before the transfer run date.

The following command creates a Klaviyo data transfer in the default project.

``` text
    bq mk
        --transfer_config
        --target_dataset=mydataset
        --data_source=klaviyo
        --display_name='My Transfer'
        --params= ' {
            "assets": [ "Events" , "Flows"] ,
            "connector.authentication.privateApiKey" : "pk_123456789123",
            "connector.startDate": "2025-10-20"
            }'
```

When you save the transfer configuration, the Klaviyo connector automatically triggers a transfer run according to your schedule option. With every transfer run, the Klaviyo connector transfers all available data from Klaviyo into BigQuery.

To manually run a data transfer outside of your regular schedule, you can start a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .

For a list of data that's included in a Klaviyo data transfer, see [Klaviyo data model reference](/bigquery/docs/klaviyo-data-model) .
