# Manage models

This document shows you how to manage BigQuery ML models, including copying models and renaming models.

## Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to read and create BigQuery models, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Data Editor](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.dataEditor) ( `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  ` ) IAM role on the project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to read and create BigQuery models. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to read and create BigQuery models:

  - To read information from models: `  bigquery.models.getData  `
  - To create models: `  bigquery.models.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Rename models

You cannot change the name of an existing model. If you need to change the model's name, follow the steps to [copy the model](#copy-model) . When you specify the destination in the copy operation, use the new model name.

## Copy models

You can copy one or more models from a source dataset to a destination dataset by:

  - Using the Google Cloud console.
  - Using the bq command-line tool's `  bq cp  ` command.
  - Calling the [jobs.insert](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/insert) API method directly and configuring a [copy job](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#JobConfigurationTableCopy) or by using the client libraries.

### Limitations on copying models

Model copy jobs are subject to the following limitations:

  - When you copy a model, the name of the destination model must adhere to the same naming conventions as when you [create a model](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#model_name) .
  - Model copies are subject to BigQuery [limits](/bigquery/quotas#copy_jobs) on copy jobs.
  - Copying a model is not supported by the Google Cloud console.
  - Copying multiple source models in a single command is not supported.
  - When you copy a model by using the CLI, the `  --destination_kms_key  ` flag is not supported.

### Copy a model

You can copy a model by:

  - Using the command-line tool's `  bq cp  ` command
  - Calling the [`  jobs.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/insert) API method and configuring a [copy job](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#JobConfigurationTableCopy) or by using the client libraries

To copy a model:

### Console

The Google Cloud console does not support copying models.

### bq

Issue the `  bq cp  ` command. Optional flags:

  - `  -f  ` or `  --force  ` overwrites an existing model in the destination dataset and doesn't prompt you for confirmation.

  - `  -n  ` or `  --no_clobber  ` returns the following error message if the model exists in the destination dataset: `  '[PROJECT_ID]:[DATASET].[MODEL]' already exists, skipping  ` .
    
    If `  -n  ` is not specified, the default behavior is to prompt you to choose whether to replace the destination model.

**Note:** The `  --destination_kms_key  ` flag is not supported when you copy a model.

If the source or destination dataset is in a project other than your default project, add the project ID to the dataset names in the following format: `  PROJECT_ID : DATASET  ` .

Supply the `  --location  ` flag and set the value to your [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) .

``` text
bq --location=LOCATION cp -f -n PROJECT_ID:DATASET.SOURCE_MODEL PROJECT_ID:DATASET.DESTINATION_MODEL
```

Replace the following:

  - LOCATION : the name of your location. The `  --location  ` flag is optional. For example, if you are using BigQuery in the Tokyo region, you can set the flag's value to `  asia-northeast1  ` . You can set a default value for the location using the [.bigqueryrc file](/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool#setting_default_values_for_command-line_flags) . For a full list of locations, see [BigQuery locations](/bigquery/docs/locations) .
  - PROJECT\_ID : your project ID.
  - DATASET : the name of the source or destination dataset.
  - SOURCE\_MODEL : the model you're copying.
  - DESTINATION\_MODEL : the name of the model in the destination dataset.

Examples:

Enter the following command to copy `  mydataset.mymodel  ` to `  mydataset2  ` . Both datasets are in your default project and were created in the `  US  ` multi-region location.

``` text
bq --location=US cp mydataset.mymodel mydataset2.mymodel
```

Enter the following command to copy `  mydataset.mymodel  ` and to overwrite a destination model with the same name. The source dataset is in your default project. The destination dataset is in `  myotherproject  ` . The `  -f  ` shortcut is used to overwrite the destination model without a prompt. `  mydataset  ` and `  myotherdataset  ` were created in the `  US  ` multi-region location.

``` text
bq --location=US cp -f mydataset.mymodel myotherproject:myotherdataset.mymodel
```

Enter the following command to copy `  mydataset.mymodel  ` and to return an error if the destination dataset contains a model with the same name. The source dataset is in your default project. The destination dataset is in `  myotherproject  ` . The `  -n  ` shortcut is used to prevent overwriting a model with the same name. Both datasets were created in the `  US  ` multi-region location.

``` text
bq --location=US cp -n mydataset.mymodel myotherproject:myotherdataset.mymodel
```

Enter the following command to copy `  mydataset.mymodel  ` to `  mydataset2  ` and to rename the model `  mymodel2  ` . Both datasets are in your default project. Both datasets were created in the `  asia-northeast1  ` region.

``` text
bq --location=asia-northeast1 cp mydataset.mymodel mydataset2.mymodel2
```

### API

To copy a model by using the API, call the [`  bigquery.jobs.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/insert) method and configure a `  copy  ` job. Specify your location in the `  location  ` property in the `  jobReference  ` section of the [job resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs) .

You must specify the following values in your job configuration:

``` text
"copy": {
      "sourceTable": {       // Required
        "projectId": string, // Required
        "datasetId": string, // Required
        "tableId": string    // Required
      },
      "destinationTable": {  // Required
        "projectId": string, // Required
        "datasetId": string, // Required
        "tableId": string    // Required
      },
      "createDisposition": string,  // Optional
      "writeDisposition": string,   // Optional
    },
```

Where:

  - `  sourceTable  ` : provides information about the model to be copied.
  - `  destinationTable  ` : provides information about the new model.
  - `  createDisposition  ` : specifies whether to create the model if it doesn't exist.
  - `  writeDisposition  ` : specifies whether to overwrite an existing model.

## Encrypt models

For more information about using a customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) to encrypt a model, see [Use CMEK to protect BigQuery ML models](/bigquery/docs/customer-managed-encryption#cmek-bqml) .
