# Load Oracle data into BigQuery

You can load data from Oracle to BigQuery using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Oracle connector. With the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, you can schedule recurring transfer jobs that add your latest data from Oracle to BigQuery.

## Limitations

Oracle transfers are subject to the following limitations:

  - The maximum number of simultaneous connections to an Oracle database is limited, and as a result, the number of simultaneous transfer runs to a single Oracle database is limited to that maximum amount.
  - You must [set up a network attachment](/vpc/docs/create-manage-network-attachments) in cases where a public IP is not available for an Oracle database connection, with the following requirements:
      - The data source must be accessible from the subnet where the network attachment resides.
      - The network attachment must not be in the subnet within the range `  240.0.0.0/24  ` .
      - Network attachments cannot be deleted if there are active connections to the attachment. To delete a network attachment, [contact Cloud Customer Care](/bigquery/docs/getting-support) .
      - For the `  us  ` multi-region, the network attachment must be in the `  us-central1  ` region. For the `  eu  ` multi-region, the network attachment must be in the `  europe-west4  ` region.
  - The minimum interval time between recurring Oracle transfers is 15 minutes. The default interval for a recurring transfer is 24 hours.
  - A single transfer configuration can only support one data transfer run at a given time. In the case where a second data transfer is scheduled to run before the first transfer is completed, then only the first data transfer completes while any other data transfers that overlap with the first transfer is skipped.
      - To avoid skipped transfers within a single transfer configuration, we recommend that you increase the duration of time between large data transfers by configuring the **Repeat frequency** .
  - During a data transfer, the Oracle connector identifies indexed and partitioned key columns to transfer your data in parallel batches. For this reason, we recommend that you specify primary key columns or use indexed columns in your table to improve the performance and reduce the error rate in your data transfers.
      - If you have indexed or primary key constraints, only the following column types are supported for creating parallel batches:
          - `  INTEGER  `
          - `  TINYINT  `
          - `  SMALLINT  `
          - `  FLOAT  `
          - `  REAL  `
          - `  DOUBLE  `
          - `  NUMERIC  `
          - `  BIGINT  `
          - `  DECIMAL  `
          - `  DATE  `
      - Oracle data transfers that don't use primary key or indexed columns can't support more than 2,000,000 records per table.
  - If your configured network attachment and virtual machine (VM) instance are located in different regions, there might be cross-region data movement when you transfer data from Oracle.

### Incremental transfer limitations

Incremental Oracle transfers are subject to the following limitations:

  - You can only choose `  TIMESTAMP  ` columns as watermark columns.
  - Incremental ingestion is only supported for assets with valid watermark columns.
  - Values in a watermark column must be monotonically increasing.
  - Incremental transfers cannot sync delete operations in the source table.
  - A single transfer configuration can only support either incremental or full ingestion.
  - You cannot update objects in the `  asset  ` list after the first incremental ingestion run.
  - You cannot change the write mode in a transfer configuration after the first incremental ingestion run.
  - You cannot change the watermark column or the primary key after the first incremental ingestion run.
  - When you update an existing transfer configuration to the incremental ingestion mode, the first data transfer run after that update will retrieve all available data from your data source and will overwrite data in the destination BigQuery table. Any subsequent incremental transfer run will retrieve only the new and updated rows from your data source.

## Data ingestion options

The following sections provide more information about the data ingestion options when you set up an Oracle data transfer.

### TLS configuration

The Oracle connector supports the configuration for transport level security (TLS) to encrypt your data transfers into BigQuery. The Oracle connector supports the following TLS configurations:

  - **Encrypt data, and verify CA and hostname** : This mode performs a full validation of the server using TLS over the TCPS protocol. It encrypts all data in transit and verifies that the database server's certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). This mode also checks that the hostname you're connecting to exactly matches the Common Name (CN) or a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) on the server's certificate. This mode prevents attackers from using a valid certificate for a different domain to impersonate your database server.
      - If your hostname does not match the certificate CN or SAN, the connection fails. You must configure a DNS resolution to match the certificate or use a different security mode.
      - Use this mode for the most secure option to prevent person-in-the-middle (PITM) attacks.
  - **Encrypt data, and verify CA only** : This mode encrypts all data using TLS over the TCPS protocol and verifies that the server's certificate is signed by a CA that the client trusts. However, this mode does not verify the server's hostname. This mode successfully connects as long as the certificate is valid and issued by a trusted VA, regardless of whether the hostname in the certificate matches the hostname you are connecting to.
      - Use this mode if you want to ensure that you are connecting to a server whose certificate is signed by a trusted CA, but the hostname is not verifiable or you don't have control over the hostname configuration.
  - **Encryption only** : This mode encrypts all data transferred between the client and the server using Oracle's Native Network Encryption over the standard TCP port. It does not perform any certificate or hostname validation.
      - This mode provides some level of security by protecting data in transit, but it can be vulnerable to PITM attacks.
      - Use this mode if you need to ensure all data is encrypted but can't or don't want to verify the server's identity. We recommend using this mode when working with private VPCs.
  - **No encryption or verification** : This mode does not encrypt any data and does not perform any certificate or hostname verification. All data is sent as plain text.
      - We don't recommend using this mode in an environment where sensitive data is handled.
      - We only recommend using this mode for testing purposes on an isolated network where security is not a concern.

#### Trusted Server Certificate (PEM)

If you are using either the **Encrypt data, and verify CA and hostname** mode or the **Encrypt data, and verify CA** mode, then you can also provide one or more PEM-encoded certificates. These certificates are required in some scenarios where the BigQuery Data Transfer Service needs to verify the identity of your database server during the TLS connection:

  - If you are using a certificate signed by a private CA within your organization or a self-signed certificate, you must provide the full certificate chain or the single self-signed certificate. This is required for certificates issued by internal CAs of managed cloud provider services, such as the Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).
  - If your database server certificate is signed by a public CA (for example, Let's Encrypt, DigiCert, or GlobalSign), you don't need to provide a certificate. The root certificates for these public CAs are pre-installed and trusted by the BigQuery Data Transfer Service.

You can provide PEM-encoded certificates in the **Trusted PEM Certificate** field when you create a Oracle transfer configuration, with the following requirements:

  - The certificate must be a valid PEM-encoded certificate chain.
  - The certificate must be entirely correct. Any missing certificates in the chain or incorrect content causes the TLS connection to fail.
  - For a single certificate, you can provide single, self-signed certificate from the database server.
  - For a full certificate chain issued by a private CA, you must provide the full chain of trust. This includes the certificate from the database server and any intermediate and root CA certificates.

### Full or incremental transfers

You can specify how data is loaded into BigQuery by selecting either the **Full** or **Incremental** write preference in the transfer configuration when you [set up an Oracle transfer](#oracle-transfer-setup) . Incremental transfers are supported in [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .

**Note:** To request feedback or support for incremental transfers, send email to <dts-preview-support@google.com> .

You can select **Full** to transfer all data from your Oracle datasets with each data transfer.

Alternatively, you can select **Incremental** ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ) to only transfer data that was changed since the last data transfer, instead of loading the entire dataset with each data transfer. If you select **Incremental** for your data transfer, you must specify either the **Append** or **Upsert** write modes to define how data is written to BigQuery during an incremental data transfer. The following sections describe the available write modes.

#### **Append** write mode

The **Append** write mode only inserts new rows to your destination table. This option strictly appends transferred data without checking for existing records, so this mode can potentially cause data duplication in the destination table.

When you select the **Append** mode, you must select a watermark column. A watermark column is required for the Oracle connector to track changes in the source table.

For Oracle transfers, we recommend selecting a column that is only updated when the record was created, and won't change with subsequent updates. For example, the `  CREATED_AT  ` column.

#### **Upsert** write mode

The **Upsert** write mode either updates a row or inserts a new row in your destination table by checking for a primary key. You can specify a primary key to let the Oracle connector determine what changes are needed to keep your destination table up-to-date with your source table. If the specified primary key is present in the destination BigQuery table during a data transfer, then the Oracle connector updates that row with new data from the source table. If a primary key is not present during a data transfer, then the Oracle connector inserts a new row.

When you select the **Upsert** mode, you must select a watermark column and a primary key:

  - A watermark column is required for the Oracle connector to track changes in the source table.
      - Select a watermark column that updates every time a row is modified. We recommend columns similar to the `  UPDATED_AT  ` or `  LAST_MODIFIED  ` column.

<!-- end list -->

  - The primary key can be one or more columns on your table that are required for the Oracle connector to determine if it needs to insert or update a row.
      - Select columns that contain non-null values that are unique across all rows of the table. We recommend columns that include system-generated identifiers, unique reference codes (for example, auto-incrementing IDs), or immutable time-based sequence IDs.
      - To prevent potential data loss or data corruption, the primary key columns that you select must have unique values. If you have doubts about the uniqueness of your chosen primary key column, then we recommend that you use the **Append** write mode instead.

## Before you begin

The following sections describe the steps that you need to take before you create an Oracle transfer.

### Oracle prerequisites

  - [Create a User credential](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B13789_01/server.101/b10759/statements_8003.htm) in the Oracle database.
  - [Grant `  Create Session  ` system privileges to the user](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B13789_01/server.101/b10759/statements_9013.htm) to allow session creation.
  - [Assign a tablespace](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/network.102/b14266/admusers.htm#i1006219) to the user account.

You must also have the following Oracle database information when creating an Oracle transfer.

### BigQuery prerequisites

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store your data.
  - If you intend to set up transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, verify that you have the `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission. Pub/Sub permissions are not required if you only set up email notifications. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer:

  - BigQuery Data Transfer Service permissions:
      - `  bigquery.transfers.update  `
      - `  bigquery.transfers.get  `
  - BigQuery permissions:
      - `  bigquery.datasets.get  `

### bq

Enter the [`  bq mk  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_mk) and supply the transfer creation flag `  --transfer_config  ` :

``` text
bq mk
    --transfer_config
    --project_id=PROJECT_ID
    --data_source=DATA_SOURCE
    --display_name=DISPLAY_NAME
    --target_dataset=DATASET
    --params='PARAMETERS'
```

Where:

  - PROJECT\_ID (optional): your Google Cloud project ID. If `  --project_id  ` isn't supplied to specify a particular project, the default project is used.

  - DATA\_SOURCE : the data source — `  oracle  ` .

  - DISPLAY\_NAME : the display name for the transfer configuration. The data transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.

  - DATASET : the target dataset for the transfer configuration.

  - PARAMETERS : the parameters for the created transfer configuration in JSON format. For example: `  --params='{"param":"param_value"}'  ` . The following are the parameters for an Oracle data transfer:
    
      - `  connector.networkAttachment  ` (optional): name of the network attachment to connect to the Oracle database.
      - `  connector.authentication.Username  ` : username of the Oracle account.
      - `  connector.authentication.Password  ` : password of the Oracle account.
      - `  connector.database  ` : name of the Oracle database.
      - `  connector.endpoint.host  ` : the hostname or IP of the database.
      - `  connector.endpoint.port  ` : the port number that the Oracle database is using for incoming connections, such as `  1520  ` .
      - `  connector.connectionType  ` : the connection URL type, either `  SERVICE  ` , `  SID  ` , or `  TNS  ` .
      - `  connector.tls.mode  ` : specify a [TLS configuration](#tls_configuration) to use with this transfer:
          - `  ENCRYPT_VERIFY_CA_AND_HOST  ` to encrypt data, and verify CA and hostname
          - `  ENCRYPT_VERIFY_CA  ` to encrypt data, and verify CA only
          - `  ENCRYPT_VERIFY_NONE  ` for data encryption only
          - `  DISABLE  ` for no encryption or verification
      - `  connector.tls.trustedServerCertificate  ` : (optional) provide one or more [PEM-encoded certificates](/bigquery/docs/mysql-transfer#trusted_server_certificate_pem) . Required only if `  connector.tls.mode  ` is `  ENCRYPT_VERIFY_CA_AND_HOST  ` or `  ENCRYPT_VERIFY_CA  ` .
      - `  ingestionType  ` : specify either `  FULL  ` or `  INCREMENTAL  ` . Incremental transfers are supported in [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) . For more information, see [Full or incremental transfers](#full_or_incremental_transfers) .
      - `  writeMode  ` : specify either `  WRITE_MODE_APPEND  ` or `  WRITE_MODE_UPSERT  ` .
      - `  watermarkColumns  ` : specify columns in your table as watermark columns. This field is required for incremental transfers.
      - `  primaryKeys  ` : specify columns in your table as primary keys. This field is required for incremental transfers.
      - `  assets  ` : the path to the Oracle objects to be transferred to BigQuery, using the format: `  DATABASE_NAME / SCHEMA_NAME / TABLE_NAME  `

When specifying multiple assets during an incremental transfer, the values of the `  watermarkColumns  ` and `  primaryKeys  ` fields correspond to the position of values in the `  assets  ` field. In the following example, `  dep_id  ` corresponds to the table `  DB1/USER1/DEPARTMENT  ` , while `  report_by  ` and `  report_title  ` corresponds to the table `  DB1/USER1/EMPLOYEES  ` .

``` text
      "primaryKeys":[['dep_id'], ['report_by','report_title']],
      "assets":["DB1/USER1/DEPARTMENT","DB1/USER1/EMPLOYEES"],
  
```

For example, the following command creates an Oracle data transfer in the default project with all the required parameters:

``` text
bq mk
    --transfer_config
    --target_dataset=mydataset
    --data_source=oracle
    --display_name='My Transfer'
    --params='{"assets":["DB1/USER1/DEPARTMENT","DB1/USER1/EMPLOYEES"],
        "connector.authentication.username": "User1",
        "connector.authentication.password":"ABC12345",
        "connector.database":"DB1",
        "connector.endpoint.host":"192.168.0.1",
        "connector.endpoint.port":1520,
        "connector.connectionType":"SERVICE",
        "connector.tls.mode": "ENCRYPT_VERIFY_CA_AND_HOST",
        "connector.tls.trustedServerCertificate": "PEM-encoded certificate",
        "connector.networkAttachment":
        "projects/dev-project1/regions/us-central1/networkattachments/na1"
        "ingestionType":"incremental",
        "writeMode":"WRITE_MODE_APPEND",
        "watermarkColumns":["createdAt","createdAt"],
        "primaryKeys":[['dep_id'], ['report_by','report_title']]}'
```

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.transferConfigs.create  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create) method and supply an instance of the [`  TransferConfig  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs#TransferConfig) resource.

When you save the transfer configuration, the Oracle connector automatically triggers a transfer run according to your schedule option. With every transfer run, the Oracle connector transfers all available data from Oracle into BigQuery.

To manually run a data transfer outside of your regular schedule, you can start a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .
