# Loading Parquet data from Cloud Storage

This page provides an overview of loading Parquet data from Cloud Storage into BigQuery.

[Parquet](http://parquet.apache.org) is an open source column-oriented data format that is widely used in the Apache Hadoop ecosystem.

When you load Parquet data from Cloud Storage, you can load the data into a new table or partition, or you can append to or overwrite an existing table or partition. When your data is loaded into BigQuery, it is converted into columnar format for [Capacitor](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/inside-capacitor-bigquerys-next-generation-columnar-storage-format) (BigQuery's storage format).

When you load data from Cloud Storage into a BigQuery table, the dataset that contains the table must be in the same regional or multi- regional location as the Cloud Storage bucket.

For information about loading Parquet data from a local file, see [Loading data from local files](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data) .

## Limitations

You are subject to the following limitations when you load data into BigQuery from a Cloud Storage bucket:

  - BigQuery does not guarantee data consistency for external data sources. Changes to the underlying data while a query is running can result in unexpected behavior.

  - BigQuery doesn't support [Cloud Storage object versioning](/storage/docs/object-versioning) . If you include a generation number in the Cloud Storage URI, then the load job fails.

  - You can't use a wildcard in the Cloud Storage URI if any of the files to be loaded have different schemas. Any difference in the position of columns qualifies as a different schema.

## Input file requirements

To avoid `  resourcesExceeded  ` errors when loading Parquet files into BigQuery, follow these guidelines:

  - Keep row sizes to 50 MB or less.
  - If your input data contains more than 100 columns, consider reducing the page size to be smaller than the default page size (1 \* 1024 \* 1024 bytes). This is especially helpful if you are using significant compression.
  - For optimal performance, aim for row group sizes of at least 16 MiB. Smaller row group sizes increase I/O and slow down loads and queries.

## Before you begin

Grant Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles that give users the necessary permissions to perform each task in this document, and create a dataset to store your data.

### Required permissions

To load data into BigQuery, you need IAM permissions to run a load job and load data into BigQuery tables and partitions. If you are loading data from Cloud Storage, you also need IAM permissions to access the bucket that contains your data.

#### Permissions to load data into BigQuery

To load data into a new BigQuery table or partition or to append or overwrite an existing table or partition, you need the following IAM permissions:

  - `  bigquery.tables.create  `
  - `  bigquery.tables.updateData  `
  - `  bigquery.tables.update  `
  - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes the permissions that you need in order to load data into a BigQuery table or partition:

  - `  roles/bigquery.dataEditor  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.dataOwner  `
  - `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` (includes the `  bigquery.jobs.create  ` permission)
  - `  bigquery.user  ` (includes the `  bigquery.jobs.create  ` permission)
  - `  bigquery.jobUser  ` (includes the `  bigquery.jobs.create  ` permission)

Additionally, if you have the `  bigquery.datasets.create  ` permission, you can create and update tables using a load job in the datasets that you create.

For more information on IAM roles and permissions in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/access-control) .

### Permissions to load data from Cloud Storage

To get the permissions that you need to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket, ask your administrator to grant you the [Storage Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/storage#storage.admin) ( `  roles/storage.admin  ` ) IAM role on the bucket. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to load data from a Cloud Storage bucket:

  - `  storage.buckets.get  `
  - `  storage.objects.get  `
  - `  storage.objects.list (required if you are using a URI wildcard )  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

### Create a dataset

Create a [BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store your data.

## Parquet schemas

When you load Parquet files into BigQuery, the table schema is automatically retrieved from the self-describing source data. When BigQuery retrieves the schema from the source data, the alphabetically last file is used.

For example, you have the following Parquet files in Cloud Storage:

``` text
gs://mybucket/00/
  a.parquet
  z.parquet
gs://mybucket/01/
  b.parquet
```

Running this command in the bq command-line tool loads all of the files (as a comma-separated list), and the schema is derived from `  mybucket/01/b.parquet  ` :

``` text
bq load \
--source_format=PARQUET \
dataset.table \
"gs://mybucket/00/*.parquet","gs://mybucket/01/*.parquet"
```

When you load multiple Parquet files that have different schemas, identical columns specified in multiple schemas must have the same [mode](/bigquery/docs/schemas#modes) in each schema definition.

When BigQuery detects the schema, some Parquet data types are converted to BigQuery data types to make them compatible with GoogleSQL syntax. For more information, see [Parquet conversions](#parquet_conversions) .

To provide a table schema for creating external tables, set the `  referenceFileSchemaUri  ` property in BigQuery API or  
`  --reference_file_schema_uri  ` parameter in bq command-line tool to the URL of the reference file.

For example, `  --reference_file_schema_uri="gs://mybucket/schema.parquet"  ` .

## Parquet compression

BigQuery supports the following compression codecs for Parquet file contents:

  - `  GZip  `
  - `  LZO_1C  `
  - `  LZO_1X  `
  - `  LZ4_RAW  `
  - `  Snappy  `
  - `  ZSTD  `

## Loading Parquet data into a new table

You can load Parquet data into a new table by using one of the following:

  - The Google Cloud console
  - The bq command-line tool's `  bq load  ` command
  - The `  jobs.insert  ` API method and configuring a `  load  ` job
  - The client libraries

To load Parquet data from Cloud Storage into a new BigQuery table:

### Console

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** .

In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then select a dataset.

In the **Dataset info** section, click add\_box **Create table** .

In the **Create table** pane, specify the following details:

1.  In the **Source** section, select **Google Cloud Storage** in the **Create table from** list. Then, do the following:
    1.  Select a file from the Cloud Storage bucket, or enter the [Cloud Storage URI](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#gcs-uri) . You cannot include multiple URIs in the Google Cloud console, but [wildcards](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#load-wildcards) are supported. The Cloud Storage bucket must be in the same location as the dataset that contains the table you want to create, append, or overwrite.
    2.  For **File format** , select **Parquet** .
2.  In the **Destination** section, specify the following details:
    1.  For **Dataset** , select the dataset in which you want to create the table.
    2.  In the **Table** field, enter the name of the table that you want to create.
    3.  Verify that the **Table type** field is set to **Native table** .
3.  In the **Schema** section, no action is necessary. The schema is self-described in Parquet files.
4.  Optional: Specify **Partition and cluster settings** . For more information, see [Creating partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/creating-partitioned-tables) and [Creating and using clustered tables](/bigquery/docs/creating-clustered-tables) .
5.  Click **Advanced options** and do the following:
      - For **Write preference** , leave **Write if empty** selected. This option creates a new table and loads your data into it.
      - If you want to ignore values in a row that are not present in the table's schema, then select **Unknown values** .
      - For **Encryption** , click **Customer-managed key** to use a [Cloud Key Management Service key](/bigquery/docs/customer-managed-encryption) . If you leave the **Google-managed key** setting, BigQuery [encrypts the data at rest](/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption) .
6.  Click **Create table** .

**Note:** When you load data into an empty table by using the Google Cloud console, you cannot add a label, description, table expiration, or partition expiration.  
  
After the table is created, you can update the table's expiration, description, and labels, but you cannot add a partition expiration after a table is created using the Google Cloud console. For more information, see [Managing tables](/bigquery/docs/managing-tables) .

### SQL

Use the [`  LOAD DATA  ` DDL statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/load-statements) . The following example loads a Parquet file into the new table `  mytable  ` :

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    LOAD DATA OVERWRITE mydataset.mytable
    FROM FILES (
      format = 'PARQUET',
      uris = ['gs://bucket/path/file.parquet']);
    ```

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### bq

Use the `  bq load  ` command, specify `  PARQUET  ` using the `  --source_format  ` flag, and include a [Cloud Storage URI](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#gcs-uri) . You can include a single URI, a comma-separated list of URIs, or a URI containing a [wildcard](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#load-wildcards) .

(Optional) Supply the `  --location  ` flag and set the value to your [location](/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations) .

Other optional flags include:

  - `  --time_partitioning_type  ` : Enables time-based partitioning on a table and sets the partition type. Possible values are `  HOUR  ` , `  DAY  ` , `  MONTH  ` , and `  YEAR  ` . This flag is optional when you create a table partitioned on a `  DATE  ` , `  DATETIME  ` , or `  TIMESTAMP  ` column. The default partition type for time-based partitioning is `  DAY  ` . You cannot change the partitioning specification on an existing table.

  - `  --time_partitioning_expiration  ` : An integer that specifies (in seconds) when a time-based partition should be deleted. The expiration time evaluates to the partition's UTC date plus the integer value.

  - `  --time_partitioning_field  ` : The `  DATE  ` or `  TIMESTAMP  ` column used to create a partitioned table. If time-based partitioning is enabled without this value, an ingestion-time partitioned table is created.

  - `  --require_partition_filter  ` : When enabled, this option requires users to include a `  WHERE  ` clause that specifies the partitions to query. Requiring a partition filter can reduce cost and improve performance. For more information, see [Require a partition filter in queries](/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) .

  - `  --clustering_fields  ` : A comma-separated list of up to four column names used to create a [clustered table](/bigquery/docs/creating-clustered-tables) .

  - `  --destination_kms_key  ` : The Cloud KMS key for encryption of the table data.

  - `  --column_name_character_map  ` : Defines the scope and handling of characters in column names, with the option of enabling [flexible column names](/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-parquet#flexible-column-names) . For more information, see [`  load_option_list  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/load-statements#load_option_list) . For more information on supported and unsupported characters, see [flexible column names](/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-parquet#flexible-column-names) .
    
    For more information on partitioned tables, see:
    
      - [Creating partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/creating-partitioned-tables)
    
    For more information on clustered tables, see:
    
      - [Creating and using clustered tables](/bigquery/docs/creating-clustered-tables)
    
    For more information on table encryption, see:
    
      - [Protecting data with Cloud KMS keys](/bigquery/docs/customer-managed-encryption)

To load Parquet data into BigQuery, enter the following command:

``` text
bq --location=LOCATION load \
--source_format=FORMAT \
DATASET.TABLE \
PATH_TO_SOURCE
```

Replace the following:

  - `  LOCATION  ` : your location. The `  --location  ` flag is optional. For example, if you are using BigQuery in the Tokyo region, you can set the flag's value to `  asia-northeast1  ` . You can set a default value for the location using the [.bigqueryrc file](/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool#setting_default_values_for_command-line_flags) .
  - `  FORMAT  ` : `  PARQUET  ` .
  - `  DATASET  ` : an existing dataset.
  - `  TABLE  ` : the name of the table into which you're loading data.
  - `  PATH_TO_SOURCE  ` : a fully qualified [Cloud Storage URI](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#gcs-uri) or a comma-separated list of URIs. [Wildcards](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#load-wildcards) are also supported.

Examples:

The following command loads data from `  gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet  ` into a table named `  mytable  ` in `  mydataset  ` .

``` text
    bq load \
    --source_format=PARQUET \
    mydataset.mytable \
    gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet
```

The following command loads data from `  gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet  ` into a new ingestion-time partitioned table named `  mytable  ` in `  mydataset  ` .

``` text
    bq load \
    --source_format=PARQUET \
    --time_partitioning_type=DAY \
    mydataset.mytable \
    gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet
```

The following command loads data from `  gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet  ` into a partitioned table named `  mytable  ` in `  mydataset  ` . The table is partitioned on the `  mytimestamp  ` column.

``` text
    bq load \
    --source_format=PARQUET \
    --time_partitioning_field mytimestamp \
    mydataset.mytable \
    gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet
```

The following command loads data from multiple files in `  gs://mybucket/  ` into a table named `  mytable  ` in `  mydataset  ` . The Cloud Storage URI uses a wildcard.

``` text
    bq load \
    --source_format=PARQUET \
    mydataset.mytable \
    gs://mybucket/mydata*.parquet
```

The following command loads data from multiple files in `  gs://mybucket/  ` into a table named `  mytable  ` in `  mydataset  ` . The command includes a comma- separated list of Cloud Storage URIs with wildcards.

``` text
    bq load \
    --source_format=PARQUET \
    mydataset.mytable \
    "gs://mybucket/00/*.parquet","gs://mybucket/01/*.parquet"
```

### API

1.  Create a `  load  ` job that points to the source data in Cloud Storage.

2.  (Optional) Specify your [location](/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations) in the `  location  ` property in the `  jobReference  ` section of the [job resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs) .

3.  The `  source URIs  ` property must be fully qualified, in the format `  gs:// BUCKET / OBJECT  ` . Each URI can contain one '\*' [wildcard character](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#load-wildcards) .

4.  Specify the Parquet data format by setting the `  sourceFormat  ` property to `  PARQUET  ` .

5.  To check the job status, call [`  jobs.get( JOB_ID *)  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/jobs/get) , replacing JOB\_ID with the ID of the job returned by the initial request.
    
      - If `  status.state = DONE  ` , the job completed successfully.
      - If the `  status.errorResult  ` property is present, the request failed, and that object includes information describing what went wrong. When a request fails, no table is created and no data is loaded.
      - If `  status.errorResult  ` is absent, the job finished successfully; although, there might have been some nonfatal errors, such as problems importing a few rows. Nonfatal errors are listed in the returned job object's `  status.errors  ` property.

**API notes:**

  - Load jobs are atomic and consistent: if a load job fails, none of the data is available, and if a load job succeeds, all of the data is available.

  - As a best practice, generate a unique ID and pass it as `  jobReference.jobId  ` when calling `  jobs.insert  ` to create a load job. This approach is more robust to network failure because the client can poll or retry on the known job ID.

  - Calling `  jobs.insert  ` on a given job ID is idempotent. You can retry as many times as you like on the same job ID, and at most one of those operations will succeed.

### Python

Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Python API reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

Use the [Client.load\_table\_from\_uri()](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.client.Client#google_cloud_bigquery_client_Client_load_table_from_uri) method to start a load job from Cloud Storage. To use Parquet, set the [LoadJobConfig.source\_format property](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.job.LoadJobConfig#google_cloud_bigquery_job_LoadJobConfig_source_format) to the string `  PARQUET  ` and pass the job config as the `  job_config  ` argument to the `  load_table_from_uri()  ` method.

``` python
from google.cloud import bigquery

# Construct a BigQuery client object.
client = bigquery.Client()

# TODO(developer): Set table_id to the ID of the table to create.
# table_id = "your-project.your_dataset.your_table_name"

job_config = bigquery.LoadJobConfig(
    source_format=bigquery.SourceFormat.PARQUET,
)
uri = "gs://cloud-samples-data/bigquery/us-states/us-states.parquet"

load_job = client.load_table_from_uri(
    uri, table_id, job_config=job_config
)  # Make an API request.

load_job.result()  # Waits for the job to complete.

destination_table = client.get_table(table_id)
print("Loaded {} rows.".format(destination_table.num_rows))
```

## Appending to or overwriting a table with Parquet data

You can load additional data into a table either from source files or by appending query results.

In the Google Cloud console, use the **Write preference** option to specify what action to take when you load data from a source file or from a query result.

You have the following options when you load additional data into a table:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Console option</th>
<th>bq tool flag</th>
<th>BigQuery API property</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

If you load data into an existing table, the load job can append the data or overwrite the table.

You can append or overwrite a table by using one of the following:

  - The Google Cloud console
  - The bq command-line tool's `  bq load  ` command
  - The `  jobs.insert  ` API method and configuring a `  load  ` job
  - The client libraries

**Note:** This page does not cover appending or overwriting partitioned tables. For information on appending and overwriting partitioned tables, see: [Appending to and overwriting partitioned table data](/bigquery/docs/managing-partitioned-table-data#append-overwrite) .

To append or overwrite a table with Parquet data:

### Console

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** .

In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project, click **Datasets** , and then select a dataset.

In the **Dataset info** section, click add\_box **Create table** .

In the **Create table** pane, specify the following details:

1.  In the **Source** section, select **Google Cloud Storage** in the **Create table from** list. Then, do the following:
    1.  Select a file from the Cloud Storage bucket, or enter the [Cloud Storage URI](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#gcs-uri) . You cannot include multiple URIs in the Google Cloud console, but [wildcards](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#load-wildcards) are supported. The Cloud Storage bucket must be in the same location as the dataset that contains the table you want to create, append, or overwrite.
    2.  For **File format** , select **Parquet** .
2.  In the **Destination** section, specify the following details:
    1.  For **Dataset** , select the dataset in which you want to create the table.
    2.  In the **Table** field, enter the name of the table that you want to create.
    3.  Verify that the **Table type** field is set to **Native table** .
3.  In the **Schema** section, no action is necessary. The schema is self-described in Parquet files.
4.  Optional: Specify **Partition and cluster settings** . For more information, see [Creating partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/creating-partitioned-tables) and [Creating and using clustered tables](/bigquery/docs/creating-clustered-tables) . You cannot convert a table to a partitioned or clustered table by appending or overwriting it. The Google Cloud console does not support appending to or overwriting partitioned or clustered tables in a load job.
5.  Click **Advanced options** and do the following:
      - For **Write preference** , choose **Append to table** or **Overwrite table** .
      - If you want to ignore values in a row that are not present in the table's schema, then select **Unknown values** .
      - For **Encryption** , click **Customer-managed key** to use a [Cloud Key Management Service key](/bigquery/docs/customer-managed-encryption) . If you leave the **Google-managed key** setting, BigQuery [encrypts the data at rest](/docs/security/encryption/default-encryption) .
6.  Click **Create table** .

### SQL

Use the [`  LOAD DATA  ` DDL statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/load-statements) . The following example appends a Parquet file to the table `  mytable  ` :

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    LOAD DATA INTO mydataset.mytable
    FROM FILES (
      format = 'PARQUET',
      uris = ['gs://bucket/path/file.parquet']);
    ```

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### bq

Enter the `  bq load  ` command with the `  --replace  ` flag to overwrite the table. Use the `  --noreplace  ` flag to append data to the table. If no flag is specified, the default is to append data. Supply the `  --source_format  ` flag and set it to `  PARQUET  ` . Because Parquet schemas are automatically retrieved from the self-describing source data, you don't need to provide a schema definition.

**Note:** It is possible to modify the table's schema when you append or overwrite it. For more information on supported schema changes during a load operation, see [Modifying table schemas](/bigquery/docs/managing-table-schemas) .

(Optional) Supply the `  --location  ` flag and set the value to your [location](/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations) .

Other optional flags include:

  - `  --destination_kms_key  ` : The Cloud KMS key for encryption of the table data.

<!-- end list -->

``` text
bq --location=LOCATION load \
--[no]replace \
--source_format=FORMAT \
DATASET.TABLE \
PATH_TO_SOURCE
```

Replace the following:

  - `  location  ` : your [location](/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations) . The `  --location  ` flag is optional. You can set a default value for the location by using the [.bigqueryrc file](/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool#setting_default_values_for_command-line_flags) .
  - `  format  ` : `  PARQUET  ` .
  - `  dataset  ` : an existing dataset.
  - `  table  ` : the name of the table into which you're loading data.
  - `  path_to_source  ` : a fully qualified [Cloud Storage URI](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#gcs-uri) or a comma-separated list of URIs. [Wildcards](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#load-wildcards) are also supported.

Examples:

The following command loads data from `  gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet  ` and overwrites a table named `  mytable  ` in `  mydataset  ` .

``` text
    bq load \
    --replace \
    --source_format=PARQUET \
    mydataset.mytable \
    gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet
```

The following command loads data from `  gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet  ` and appends data to a table named `  mytable  ` in `  mydataset  ` .

``` text
    bq load \
    --noreplace \
    --source_format=PARQUET \
    mydataset.mytable \
    gs://mybucket/mydata.parquet
```

For information on appending and overwriting partitioned tables using the bq command-line tool, see [Appending to and overwriting partitioned table data](/bigquery/docs/managing-partitioned-table-data#append-overwrite) .

### API

1.  Create a `  load  ` job that points to the source data in Cloud Storage.

2.  (Optional) Specify your [location](/bigquery/docs/dataset-locations) in the `  location  ` property in the `  jobReference  ` section of the [job resource](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs) .

3.  The `  source URIs  ` property must be fully qualified, in the format `  gs:// BUCKET / OBJECT  ` . You can include multiple URIs as a comma-separated list. Note that [wildcards](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data#load-wildcards) are also supported.

4.  Specify the data format by setting the `  configuration.load.sourceFormat  ` property to `  PARQUET  ` .

5.  Specify the write preference by setting the `  configuration.load.writeDisposition  ` property to `  WRITE_TRUNCATE  ` or `  WRITE_APPEND  ` .

To replace the rows in an existing table, set the [`  LoadJobConfig.write_disposition  ` property](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.job.LoadJobConfig#google_cloud_bigquery_job_LoadJobConfig_write_disposition) to [`  WRITE_TRUNCATE  `](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest/google.cloud.bigquery.enums.WriteDisposition#google.cloud.bigquery.enums.WriteDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE) .

``` python
import io

from google.cloud import bigquery

# Construct a BigQuery client object.

## Loading hive-partitioned Parquet data

BigQuery supports loading hive partitioned Parquet data stored on Cloud Storage and populates the hive partitioning columns as columns in the destination BigQuery managed table. For more information, see [Loading externally partitioned data](/bigquery/docs/hive-partitioned-loads-gcs) .

## Parquet conversions

This section describes how BigQuery parses various data types when loading Parquet data.

Some Parquet data types (such as `  INT32  ` , `  INT64  ` , `  BYTE_ARRAY  ` , and `  FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY  ` ) can be converted into multiple BigQuery data types. To ensure BigQuery converts the Parquet data types correctly, specify the appropriate data type in the Parquet file.

For example, to convert the Parquet `  INT32  ` data type to the BigQuery `  DATE  ` data type, specify the following:

``` text
optional int32 date_col (DATE);
```

BigQuery converts Parquet data types to the BigQuery data types that are described in the following sections.

Nested groups are converted into [`  STRUCT  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#struct_type) types. Other combinations of Parquet types and converted types are not supported.

### Unsigned logical types

The Parquet `  UINT_8  ` , `  UINT_16  ` , `  UINT_32  ` , and `  UINT_64  ` types are unsigned. BigQuery will treat values with these types as unsigned when loading into a BigQuery signed `  INTEGER  ` column. In the case of `  UINT_64  ` , an error will be returned if the unsigned value exceeds the maximum `  INTEGER  ` value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

### Decimal logical type

`  Decimal  ` logical types can be converted to `  NUMERIC  ` , `  BIGNUMERIC  ` , or `  STRING  ` types. The converted type depends on the precision and scale parameters of the `  decimal  ` logical type and the specified decimal target types. Specify the decimal target type as follows:

  - For a [load job](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data) using the [`  jobs.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/insert) API: use the [`  JobConfigurationLoad.decimalTargetTypes  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#JobConfigurationLoad.FIELDS.decimal_target_types) field.
  - For a [load job](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data) using the [`  bq load  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_load) command in the bq command-line tool: use the [`  --decimal_target_types  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#flags_and_arguments_9) flag.
  - For a query against a [table with external sources](/bigquery/external-data-sources) : use the [`  ExternalDataConfiguration.decimalTargetTypes  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables#ExternalDataConfiguration.FIELDS.decimal_target_types) field.
  - For a [persistent external table created with DDL](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language) : use the [`  decimal_target_types  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#external_table_option_list) option.

### Enum logical type

`  Enum  ` logical types can be converted to `  STRING  ` or `  BYTES  ` . Specify the converted target type as follows:

  - For a [load job](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data) using the [`  jobs.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/insert) API: use the [`  JobConfigurationLoad.parquetOptions  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#JobConfigurationLoad.FIELDS.parquet_options) field.
  - For a [load job](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data) using the [`  bq load  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_load) command in the bq command-line tool: use the [`  --parquet_enum_as_string  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#parquet_enum_as_string_flag) flag.
  - For a persistent external table created with [`  bq mk  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_mk) : use the [`  --parquet_enum_as_string  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#mk-table) flag.

### List logical type

You can enable schema inference for Parquet `  LIST  ` logical types. BigQuery checks whether the `  LIST  ` node is in the [standard form](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#lists) or in one of the forms described by the [backward-compatibility rules](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#backward-compatibility-rules) :

``` text
// standard form
<optional | required> group <name> (LIST) {
  repeated group list {
    <optional | required> <element-type> element;
  }
}
```

If yes, the corresponding field for the `  LIST  ` node in the converted schema is treated as if the node has the following schema:

``` text
repeated <element-type> <name>
```

The nodes "list" and "element" are omitted.

  - For a [load job](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data) using the [`  jobs.insert  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/insert) API, use the [`  JobConfigurationLoad.parquetOptions  ` field](/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job#JobConfigurationLoad.FIELDS.parquet_options) .
  - For a [load job](/bigquery/docs/batch-loading-data) using the [`  bq load  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_load) command in the bq command-line tool, use the [`  --parquet_enable_list_inference  ` flag](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#parquet_enable_list_inference_flag) .
  - For a persistent external table created with [`  bq mk  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_mk) , use the [`  --parquet_enable_list_inference  ` flag](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#mk-table) .
  - For a persistent external table created with the [`  CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE  ` statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_external_table_statement) , use the [`  enable_list_inference  ` option](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#external_table_option_list) .

### Geospatial data

You can load Parquet files that contain [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) , hex-encoded [WKB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) , or [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) in a `  STRING  ` column, or [WKB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) in a `  BYTE_ARRAY  ` column by specifying a BigQuery schema with the type `  GEOGRAPHY  ` . For more information, see [Loading geospatial data](/bigquery/docs/geospatial-data#loading_geospatial_data) .

You can also load [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org) files. In this case, the columns described by the GeoParquet metadata are interpreted as type `  GEOGRAPHY  ` by default. You can also load the raw WKB data into a `  BYTES  ` column by providing an explicit schema. For more information, see [Loading GeoParquet files](/bigquery/docs/geospatial-data#loading_geoparquet_files) .

### Column name conversions

A column name can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (\_), and it must start with a letter or underscore. If you use flexible column names, BigQuery supports starting a column name with a number. Exercise caution when starting columns with a number, since using flexible column names with the BigQuery Storage Read API or BigQuery Storage Write API requires special handling. For more information about flexible column name support, see [flexible column names](#flexible-column-names) .

Column names have a maximum length of 300 characters. Column names can't use any of the following prefixes:

  - `  _TABLE_  `
  - `  _FILE_  `
  - `  _PARTITION  `
  - `  _ROW_TIMESTAMP  `
  - `  __ROOT__  `
  - `  _COLIDENTIFIER  `
  - `  _CHANGE_SEQUENCE_NUMBER  `
  - `  _CHANGE_TYPE  `
  - `  _CHANGE_TIMESTAMP  `

Duplicate column names are not allowed even if the case differs. For example, a column named `  Column1  ` is considered identical to a column named `  column1  ` . To learn more about column naming rules, see [Column names](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical#column_names) in the GoogleSQL reference.

If a table name (for example, `  test  ` ) is the same as one of its column names (for example, `  test  ` ), the `  SELECT  ` expression interprets the `  test  ` column as a `  STRUCT  ` containing all other table columns. To avoid this collision, use one of the following methods:

  - Avoid using the same name for a table and its columns.

  - Avoid using `  _field_  ` as a column name prefix. System-reserved prefixes cause automatic renaming during queries. For example, the `  SELECT _field_ FROM project1.dataset.test  ` query returns a column named `  _field_1  ` . If you must query a column with this name, use an alias to control the output.

  - Assign the table a different alias. For example, the following query assigns a table alias `  t  ` to the table `  project1.dataset.test  ` :
    
    ``` text
    SELECT test FROM project1.dataset.test AS t;
    ```

  - Include the table name when referencing a column. For example:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT test.test FROM project1.dataset.test;
    ```

### Flexible column names

You have more flexibility in what you name columns, including expanded access to characters in languages other than English as well as additional symbols. Make sure to use backtick ( ``  `  `` ) characters to enclose flexible column names if they are [Quoted Identifiers](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical#quoted_identifiers) .

Flexible column names support the following characters:

  - Any letter in any language, as represented by the Unicode regular expression [`  \p{L}  `](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values) .
  - Any numeric character in any language as represented by the Unicode regular expression [`  \p{N}  `](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values) .
  - Any connector punctuation character, including underscores, as represented by the Unicode regular expression [`  \p{Pc}  `](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values) .
  - A hyphen or dash as represented by the Unicode regular expression [`  \p{Pd}  `](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values) .
  - Any mark intended to accompany another character as represented by the Unicode regular expression [`  \p{M}  `](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#General_Category_Values) . For example, accents, umlauts, or enclosing boxes.
  - The following special characters:
      - An ampersand ( `  &  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0026  ` .
      - A percent sign ( `  %  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0025  ` .
      - An equals sign ( `  =  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u003D  ` .
      - A plus sign ( `  +  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u002B  ` .
      - A colon ( `  :  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u003A  ` .
      - An apostrophe ( `  '  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0027  ` .
      - A less-than sign ( `  <  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u003C  ` .
      - A greater-than sign ( `  >  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u003E  ` .
      - A number sign ( `  #  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0023  ` .
      - A vertical line ( `  |  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u007c  ` .
      - Whitespace.

Flexible column names don't support the following special characters:

  - An exclamation mark ( `  !  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0021  ` .
  - A quotation mark ( `  "  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0022  ` .
  - A dollar sign ( `  $  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0024  ` .
  - A left parenthesis ( `  (  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0028  ` .
  - A right parenthesis ( `  )  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0029  ` .
  - An asterisk ( `  *  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u002A  ` .
  - A comma ( `  ,  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u002C  ` .
  - A period ( `  .  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u002E  ` . Periods are *not* replaced by underscores in Parquet file column names when a column name character map is used. For more information, see [flexible column limitations](/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage-parquet#limitations_2) .
  - A slash ( `  /  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u002F  ` .
  - A semicolon ( `  ;  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u003B  ` .
  - A question mark ( `  ?  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u003F  ` .
  - An at sign ( `  @  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0040  ` .
  - A left square bracket ( `  [  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u005B  ` .
  - A backslash ( `  \  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u005C  ` .
  - A right square bracket ( `  ]  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u005D  ` .
  - A circumflex accent ( `  ^  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u005E  ` .
  - A grave accent ( ``  `  `` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u0060  ` .
  - A left curly bracket { `  {  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u007B  ` .
  - A right curly bracket ( `  }  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u007D  ` .
  - A tilde ( `  ~  ` ) as represented by the Unicode regular expression `  \u007E  ` .

For additional guidelines, see [Column names](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical#column_names) .

The expanded column characters are supported by both the BigQuery Storage Read API and the BigQuery Storage Write API. To use the expanded list of Unicode characters with the BigQuery Storage Read API, you must set a flag. You can use the `  displayName  ` attribute to retrieve the column name. The following example shows how to set a flag with the Python client:

``` text
from google.cloud.bigquery_storage import types
requested_session = types.ReadSession()

#set avro serialization options for flexible column.
options = types.AvroSerializationOptions()
options.enable_display_name_attribute = True
requested_session.read_options.avro_serialization_options = options
```

To use the expanded list of Unicode characters with the BigQuery Storage Write API, you must provide the schema with `  column_name  ` notation, unless you are using the `  JsonStreamWriter  ` writer object. The following example shows how to provide the schema:

``` text
syntax = "proto2";
package mypackage;
// Source protos located in github.com/googleapis/googleapis
import "google/cloud/bigquery/storage/v1/annotations.proto";

message FlexibleSchema {
  optional string item_name_column = 1
  [(.google.cloud.bigquery.storage.v1.column_name) = "name-列"];
  optional string item_description_column = 2
  [(.google.cloud.bigquery.storage.v1.column_name) = "description-列"];
}
```

In this example, `  item_name_column  ` and `  item_description_column  ` are placeholder names which need to be compliant with the [protocol buffer](https://protobuf.dev/) naming convention. Note that `  column_name  ` annotations always take precedence over placeholder names.

#### Limitations

  - Flexible column names are not supported with [external tables](/bigquery/docs/external-tables) .

  - You cannot load Parquet files containing columns that have a period (.) in the column name.

  - Column names from Parquet files are treated as case-insensitive when loaded into BigQuery. Identical case-insensitive names will cause collisions. To avoid this, either append an underscore to one of the duplicate column names or rename the columns before loading.

### Debugging your Parquet file

If your load jobs fail with data errors, you can use [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) to verify if your Parquet data files are corrupted. If PyArrow fails to read the files, the files are likely to be rejected by the BigQuery load job. The following example shows how to read the contents of a Parquet file by using PyArrow:

``` text
from pyarrow import parquet as pq

# Read the entire file
pq.read_table('your_sample_file.parquet')
# Read specific columns
pq.read_table('your_sample_file.parquet',columns=['some_column', 'another_column'])
# Read the metadata of specific columns
file_metadata=pq.read_metadata('your_sample_file.parquet')
for col in file_metadata.row_group(0).to_dict()['columns']:
    print col['column_path_in_schema']
    print col['num_values']
```

For more information, see the [PyArrow docs](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) .
