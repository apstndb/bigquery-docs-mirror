# Work with legacy slot reservations

**Note:** Legacy reservations, including access to flat-rate billing or certain commitment lengths, are only available to allow-listed customers. To determine if you have access to these legacy features, contact your administrator. The flat-rate billing model defines how you are billed for compute, but flat-rate reservations and commitments function as Enterprise edition slots.

The BigQuery Reservation API lets you purchase dedicated slots (called [*commitments*](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#slot_commitments) ), create pools of slots (called [*reservations*](/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro#reservations) ), and assign projects, folders, and organizations to those reservations.

Reservations allow you to assign a dedicated number of slots to a workload. For example, you might not want a production workload to compete with test workloads for slots. You could create a reservation named `  prod  ` and assign your production workloads to this reservation. For more information, see [Reservations](/bigquery/docs/reservations-intro#reservations) .

## Create reservations

### Required permissions

To create a reservation, you need the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission:

  - `  bigquery.reservations.create  ` on the [administration project](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#admin-project) that maintains ownership of the commitments.

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes this permission:

  - `  BigQuery Admin  `
  - `  BigQuery Resource Admin  `
  - `  BigQuery Resource Editor  `

For more information about IAM roles in BigQuery, see [Predefined roles and permissions](/bigquery/docs/access-control) .

### Create a reservation with dedicated slots

Select one of the following options:

### Console

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the BigQuery page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Capacity management** .

3.  Click **Create reservation** .

4.  In the **Reservation name** field, enter a name for the reservation.

5.  In the **Location** drop-down list, select the location.

6.  In the **Capacity Model** section, select the capacity model.

7.  If you select the **Flat-Rate** option, under **Baseline slots** , enter the number of slots for the reservation.
    
    1.  In the **Max reservation size selector** list, select the maximum reservation size.
    
    2.  Optional: In the **Baseline slots** field, enter the number of baseline slots for the reservation. To use only the specified slot capacity, click the **Ignore idle slots** toggle.
        
        The amount of autoscaling slots available to you is determined by subtracting the baseline slots value from the maximum reservation size value. For example, if you create a reservation with 100 baseline slots and a max reservation size of 400, your reservation has 300 autoscaling slots. For more information about baseline slots, see [Using reservations with baseline and autoscaling slots](/bigquery/docs/slots-autoscaling-intro#using_reservations_with_baseline_and_autoscaling_slots) .

8.  To disable [idle slot sharing](/bigquery/docs/slots#idle_slots) , click the **Ignore idle slots** toggle.

9.  The breakdown of slots is displayed in the **Cost estimate** table. A summary of the reservation is displayed in the **Capacity summary** table.

10. Click **Save** .

The new reservation is visible in the **Reservations** tab.

### SQL

To create a reservation, use the [`  CREATE RESERVATION  ` DDL statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_reservation_statement) .

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE RESERVATION
      `ADMIN_PROJECT_ID.region-LOCATION.RESERVATION_NAME`
    OPTIONS (
      slot_capacity = NUMBER_OF_BASELINE_SLOTS,
    );
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the [administration project](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#admin-project) that owns the reservation resource
    
      - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the reservation. If you select a [BigQuery Omni location](/bigquery/docs/omni-introduction#locations) , your edition option is limited to the Enterprise edition.
    
      - `  RESERVATION_NAME  ` : the name of the reservation
        
        It must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number and contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes.
    
      - `  NUMBER_OF_BASELINE_SLOTS  ` : the number of baseline slots to allocate to the reservation. You cannot set the `  slot_capacity  ` option and the `  edition  ` option in the same reservation.
    
      - `  EDITION  ` : the edition of the reservation. Assigning a reservation to an edition comes with feature and pricing changes. For more information, see [Introduction to BigQuery editions](/bigquery/docs/editions-intro) .
    
      - `  NUMBER_OF_AUTOSCALING_SLOTS  ` : the number of autoscaling slots assigned to the reservation. This is equal to the value of the max reservation size minus the number of baseline slots.

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### bq

To create a reservation, use the `  bq mk  ` command with the `  --reservation  ` flag:

``` text
bq mk \
    --project_id=ADMIN_PROJECT_ID \
    --location=LOCATION \
    --reservation \
    --slots=NUMBER_OF_BASELINE_SLOTS \
    --ignore_idle_slots=false \
    RESERVATION_NAME
```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID

  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the reservation. If you select a [BigQuery Omni location](/bigquery/docs/omni-introduction#locations) , your edition option is limited to the Enterprise edition.

  - `  NUMBER_OF_BASELINE_SLOTS  ` : the number of baseline slots to allocate to the reservation

  - `  RESERVATION_NAME  ` : the name of the reservation

  - `  EDITION  ` : the edition of the reservation. Assigning a reservation to an edition comes with feature and pricing changes. For more information, see [Introduction to BigQuery editions](/bigquery/docs/editions-intro) .

  - `  NUMBER_OF_AUTOSCALING_SLOTS  ` : the number of autoscaling slots assigned to the reservation. This is equal to the value of the max reservation size minus the number of baseline slots.

For information about the `  --ignore_idle_slots  ` flag, see [Idle slots](/bigquery/docs/slots#idle_slots) . The default value is `  false  ` .

    reservation=reservation, update_mask=field_mask
)

print(f"Updated reservation: {reservation.name}")
print(f"\tslot_capacity: {reservation.slot_capacity}")
```

### Configure whether queries use idle slots

The `  --ignore_idle_slots  ` flag controls whether queries running in a reservation can use idle slots from other reservations. For more information, see [Idle slots](/bigquery/docs/slots#idle_slots) . You can update this configuration on an existing reservation.

To update a reservation, use the `  bq update  ` command with the `  --reservation  ` flag . The following example sets `  --ignore_idle_slots  ` to `  true  ` , meaning the reservation will only use slots allocated to the reservation.

``` text
bq update \
    --project_id=ADMIN_PROJECT_ID \
    --location=LOCATION \
    --ignore_idle_slots=true \
    --reservation RESERVATION_NAME
```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the reservation
  - `  RESERVATION_NAME  ` : the name of the reservation

### List the idle slot configuration

To list the [idle slots](/bigquery/docs/slots#idle_slots) setting for a reservation, do the following:

### SQL

Query the `  ignore_idle_slots  ` column of the [`  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESERVATIONS_BY_PROJECT  ` view](/bigquery/docs/information-schema-reservations#schema) .

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      reservation_name,
      ignore_idle_slots
    FROM
      `ADMIN_PROJECT_ID.region-LOCATION`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RESERVATIONS_BY_PROJECT;
    ```
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the [administration project](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#admin-project) that owns the reservation resources
      - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the reservations

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

For more information about how to run queries, see [Run an interactive query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries#queries) .

### bq

Use the `  bq ls  ` command with the `  --reservation  ` flag:

``` text
bq ls --reservation \
    --project_id=ADMIN_PROJECT_ID \
    --location=LOCATION
```

Replace the following:

  - `  ADMIN_PROJECT_ID  ` : the project ID of the [administration project](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#admin-project) that owns the reservation resources
  - `  LOCATION  ` : the [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) of the reservations

The `  ignoreIdleSlots  ` field contains the configuration setting.

## Delete reservations

When you delete a reservation, any jobs that are currently executing with slots from that reservation will fail. To prevent errors, allow running jobs to complete before deleting the reservation.

### Required permissions

To delete a reservation, you need the following Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission:

  - `  bigquery.reservations.delete  ` on the [administration project](/bigquery/docs/reservations-workload-management#admin-project) that maintains ownership of the commitments.

Each of the following predefined IAM roles includes this permission:

  - `  BigQuery Admin  `

## Add BigQuery Reservation API to VPC Service Controls

**Note:** This feature may not be available when using reservations that are created with certain BigQuery editions. For more information about which features are enabled in each edition, see [Introduction to BigQuery editions](/bigquery/docs/editions-intro) .

The BigQuery Reservation API supports [VPC Service Controls](/vpc-service-controls) . To integrate the BigQuery Reservation API with VPC Service Controls, follow the instructions in [Create a service perimeter](/vpc-service-controls/docs/create-service-perimeters) , and add the BigQuery Reservation API to the protected services.

A service perimeter protects access to reservations, commitments, and assignments within administration projects that are specified in the perimeter. When creating an assignment, the VPC Service Controls protects the administration project and assignee project, folder, and organization.
