BigQuery works with Active Assist to provide various recommendations that you can use to optimize your BigQuery resources.

Recommendations are generated by *recommenders* , which use machine learning (ML) or heuristics to provide recommendations on how to optimize your BigQuery resource usage.

You can view and manage recommendations across the different recommenders by using BigQuery in the Google Cloud console—either in the BigQuery Active Assist, or by recommendation notifications in BigQuery Studio. You can also view recommendations through various `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` views at the project and organization level.

To view your BigQuery recommendations along with other recommendations across the Google Cloud console, use the [Active Assist](/recommender/docs/recommendation-hub/find-recommnedation-hub) .

## BigQuery recommenders

BigQuery offers the following recommenders:

  - [Partitioning and clustering recommender](/bigquery/docs/view-partition-cluster-recommendations) , which analyzes your query behavior to find opportunities for partitioning and clustering to optimize your BigQuery tables.
  - [Materialized view recommender](/bigquery/docs/manage-materialized-recommendations) , which finds opportunities to use materialized views to optimize your workflows.
  - [IAM recommender](/policy-intelligence/docs/role-recommendations-overview) , which analyzes permissions on your BigQuery datasets and suggests Identity and Access Management (IAM) role updates for principals that have excess permissions.

## View recommendations

To view your recommendations using the Google Cloud console, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the navigation menu, click **Recommendations** .
    
    The **Recommendations** page opens, showing all recommendations that are generated for the current project or organization, depending on the selected scope.

3.  To see more information about a specific recommendation or insight, click a recommendation.

### View recommendations with `     INFORMATION_SCHEMA    `

You can also view your recommendations and insights using `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` views. For example, you can use the `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RECOMMENDATIONS  ` view to view your top three recommendations based on slots savings, as seen in the following example:

``` text
SELECT
   recommender,
   target_resources,
   LAX_INT64(additional_details.overview.bytesSavedMonthly) / POW(1024, 3) as est_gb_saved_monthly,
   LAX_INT64(additional_details.overview.slotMsSavedMonthly) / (1000 * 3600) as slot_hours_saved_monthly,
  last_updated_time
FROM
  `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.RECOMMENDATIONS
WHERE
   primary_impact.category = 'COST'
AND
   state = 'ACTIVE'
ORDER by
   slot_hours_saved_monthly DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

**Note:** `  INFORMATION_SCHEMA  ` view names are case sensitive.

The result is similar to the following:

``` text
+---------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    recommender                    |   target_resources      | est_gb_saved_monthly | slot_hours_saved_monthly |  last_updated_time
