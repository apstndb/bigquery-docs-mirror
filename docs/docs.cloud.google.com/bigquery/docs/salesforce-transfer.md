# Load Salesforce data into BigQuery

You can load data from your Salesforce Sales Account to BigQuery using the BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Salesforce connector. With the BigQuery Data Transfer Service, you can schedule recurring transfer jobs that add your latest data from your Salesforce Sales Account to BigQuery.

## Limitations

Salesforce data transfers are subject to the following limitations:

  - The Salesforce connector only supports transfers from a Salesforce Sales Account.
  - The Salesforce connector only supports fields included in Salesforce Bulk API V1 version 64.0. Some fields that were included in previous versions of the Salesforce Bulk API might not be supported. For more information about these changes to the Salesforce connector, see [Salesforce Bulk API](/bigquery/docs/transfer-changes#salesforce) .
  - The Salesforce connector uses Salesforce Bulk API V1 to connect to the Salesforce endpoint to retrieve data.
      - The Salesforce connector only supports the Salesforce Bulk API V1 to connect to the Salesforce instance, and only supports the transfer of entities which are supported by the Salesforce Bulk API. For more information about what entities are supported, see ['Entity is not supported by the Bulk API' error](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000383508&type=1) .
  - The Salesforce connector does not support the transfer of the following objects that have binary fields.
      - `  Attachment  `
      - `  ContentVersion  `
      - `  Document  `
      - `  StaticResource  `
      - `  Scontrol  `
      - `  EmailCapture  `
      - `  MailMergeTemplate  `
  - The minimum interval time between recurring data transfers is 15 minutes. The default interval for a recurring transfer is 24 hours.
  - Due to Salesforce processing limits, scheduling too many data transfers at a time can lead to delays or failures. We recommend that you limit Salesforce data transfers to the following:
      - Have no more than 10 assets per transfer configuration.
      - Across your different transfer configurations, have no more than 10 simultaneous transfer runs at a time.
  - A single transfer configuration can only support one data transfer run at a given time. In the case where a second data transfer is scheduled to run before the first transfer is completed, then only the first data transfer completes while any other data transfers that overlap with the first transfer is skipped.
      - To avoid skipped transfers within a single transfer configuration, we recommend that you increase the duration of time between large data transfers by configuring the **Repeat frequency** .
  - If you are using network attachments with your data transfer, you must [set up a public network address translation (NAT)](/nat/docs/set-up-manage-network-address-translation) with a static IP address. For more information, see [Setup IP allowlist for Salesforce transfers](#salesforce-allowlist) .
  - If your configured network attachment and virtual machine (VM) instance are located in different regions, there might be cross-region data movement when you transfer data from Salesforce.

### Incremental transfer limitations

Incremental Salesforce transfers are subject to the following limitations:

  - You can only choose `  TIMESTAMP  ` columns as watermark columns.
  - Incremental ingestion is only supported for assets with valid watermark columns.
  - Values in a watermark column must be monotonically increasing.
  - Incremental transfers cannot sync delete operations in the source table.
  - A single transfer configuration can only support either incremental or full ingestion.
  - You cannot update objects in the `  asset  ` list after the first incremental ingestion run.
  - You cannot change the write mode in a transfer configuration after the first incremental ingestion run.
  - You cannot change the watermark column or the primary key after the first incremental ingestion run.
  - When you update an existing transfer configuration to the incremental ingestion mode, the first data transfer run after that update will retrieve all available data from your data source and will overwrite data in the destination BigQuery table. Any subsequent incremental transfer run will retrieve only the new and updated rows from your data source.

## Data ingestion options

The following sections provide more information on the data ingestion options when you set up a Salesforce data transfer.

### Full or incremental transfers

You can specify how data is loaded into BigQuery by selecting either the **Full** or **Incremental** write preference in the transfer configuration when you [set up a Salesforce transfer](#sf-transfer-setup) . Incremental transfers are supported in [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) .

**Note:** To request feedback or support for incremental transfers, send email to <dts-preview-support@google.com> .

You can select **Full** to transfer all data from your Salesforce datasets with each data transfer.

Alternatively, you can select **Incremental** ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ) to only transfer data that was changed since the last data transfer, instead of loading the entire dataset with each data transfer. If you select **Incremental** for your data transfer, you must specify either the **Append** or **Upsert** write modes to define how data is written to BigQuery during an incremental data transfer. The following sections describe the available write modes.

#### **Append** write mode

The **Append** write mode only inserts new rows to your destination table. This option strictly appends transferred data without checking for existing records, so this mode can potentially cause data duplication in the destination table.

When you select the **Append** mode, you must select a watermark column. A watermark column is required for the Salesforce connector to track changes in the source table.

For Salesforce transfers, we recommend selecting a column that is only updated when the record was created, and won't change with subsequent updates. For example, the `  CreatedDate  ` column.

#### **Upsert** write mode

The **Upsert** write mode either updates a row or inserts a new row in your destination table by checking for a primary key. You can specify a primary key to let the Salesforce connector determine what changes are needed to keep your destination table up-to-date with your source table. If the specified primary key is present in the destination BigQuery table during a data transfer, then the Salesforce connector updates that row with new data from the source table. If a primary key is not present during a data transfer, then the Salesforce connector inserts a new row.

When you select the **Upsert** mode, you must select a watermark column and a primary key:

  - A watermark column is required for the Salesforce connector to track changes in the source table.
      - Select a watermark column that updates every time a row is modified. We recommend using the `  SystemModstamp  ` or `  LastModifiedDate  ` column.

<!-- end list -->

  - The primary key can be one or more columns on your table that are required for the Salesforce connector to determine if it needs to insert or update a row.
      - Select columns that contain non-null values that are unique across all rows of the table. We recommend columns that include system-generated identifiers, unique reference codes (for example, auto-incrementing IDs), or immutable time-based sequence IDs.
      - To prevent potential data loss or data corruption, the primary key columns that you select must have unique values. If you have doubts about the uniqueness of your chosen primary key column, then we recommend that you use the **Append** write mode instead.

## Before you begin

The following sections describe the steps that you need to take before you create a Salesforce data transfer.

### Create a Salesforce Connected App

You must [create a Salesforce Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create.htm&type=5) with the following required configurations:

  - [Configure the Basic Information](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_basics.htm&type=5) in the Connected App. The **Connected App Name** and **Contact Email** fields are required for a Salesforce transfer.
  - [Enable OAuth Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create_api_integration.htm&type=5) with the following configurations:
      - Select the **Enable OAuth Settings** checkbox.
      - In the **Callback URL** field, enter the following:
          - For a production environment, enter `  https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token  ` .
          - For a sandbox environment, enter `  https://test.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token  ` .
      - Verify that the **Issue JSON Web Token(JWT)-based access tokens for named users** checkbox isn't selected.
  - In the **Selected OAuth Scopes** section, select **Manage user data via APIs (api)** .
  - Clear the **Required Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) Extension for Supported Authorization Flows** checkbox.
  - Select the **Enable Client Credentials Flow** , then click **OK** on the notice that appears.

Once you have configured the Connected App with the required configurations, click **Save** . You are redirected to the detail page of your newly created Connected App.

Once you have created the Connected App, you must also configure the client credentials flow by doing the following:

1.  Click **Setup** .
2.  In the search bar, search for *Connected Apps* .
3.  Click **Manage Apps** \> **Connected Apps** . If you are using the Salesforce Lightning Experience, click **Manage Connected Apps** .

### Setup IP allowlist for Salesforce transfers

You must configure your Google Cloud environment and your Salesforce account to add specific IP addresses to the allowlist for data transfers. This ensures that Salesforce only accepts connections from a trusted, static IP address. This step is required if you are using network attachments with your data transfers.

To do so, you must first set up and configure your Google Cloud network to use a static IP address:

1.  [Set up a public network address translation (NAT)](/nat/docs/set-up-manage-network-address-translation) with a static IP address within your Virtual Private Cloud network. The CloudNAT must be configured within the same region as the destination dataset for this data transfer.
2.  [Set up a network attachment](/vpc/docs/create-manage-network-attachments) within the same VPC network. This resource is used by the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to access private services.

Next, you must [configure the trusted IP ranges in Salesforce](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.security_networkaccess.htm&type=5) . When adding the range of the IP address, use the static IP address from your Google Cloud public NAT for both the beginning and ending IP addresses for the IP range.

**Note:** For more granular control, you can apply IP restrictions at the profile level or on every API call. For more information, see [Restrict Login IP Addresses in Profiles](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=platform.login_ip_ranges.htm&type=5) .

Once you have set up the IP ranges, you can now specify the static IP when you [set up your transfer configuration](/bigquery/docs/sfmc-transfer#sfmc-transfer-setup) by selecting your network attachment in the **Network attachment** field.

### BigQuery prerequisites

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store your data.
  - If you intend to set up transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, ensure that you have the `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission. Pub/Sub permissions are not required if you only set up email notifications. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer:

  - BigQuery Data Transfer Service permissions:
      - `  bigquery.transfers.update  `
      - `  bigquery.transfers.get  `
  - BigQuery permissions:
      - `  bigquery.datasets.get  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.update  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information, see [Grant `  bigquery.admin  ` access](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service#grant_bigqueryadmin_access) .

## Set up a Salesforce data transfer

Add Salesforce data into BigQuery by setting up a transfer configuration using one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the Data transfers page in the Google Cloud console.

2.  Click add **Create transfer** .

3.  In the **Source type** section, for **Source** , choose **Salesforce** .

4.  In the **Data source details** section, do the following:
    
      - For **Network attachment** , select a network attachment from the list. You must [configure your public NAT and set up your IP allow list](/bigquery/docs/salesforce-transfer#salesforce-allowlist) before you can use a network attachment with this data transfer.
      - For **My Domain** , enter your Salesforce [My Domain](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.domain_name_overview.htm) .
      - For **Client ID** , enter the Salesforce connected application Consumer Key.
      - For **Client secret** , enter the Salesforce connected application Consumer Secret.
      - For **Ingestion type** , select **Full** or **Incremental** .
          - If you select **Incremental** ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ), for **Write mode** , select either **Append** or **Upsert** . For more information about the different write modes, see [Full or incremental transfers](/bigquery/docs/salesforce-transfer#full_or_incremental_transfers) .
      - For **Salesforce objects to transfer** , click **Browse** :
          - Select any objects to be transferred to the BigQuery destination dataset. You can also manually enter any objects to include in the data transfer in this field.
          - If you have selected **Append** as your incremental write mode, you must select a column as the watermark column.
          - If you have selected **Upsert** as your incremental write mode, you must select a column as the watermark column, and then select one or more columns as the primary key.

5.  In the **Destination settings** section, for **Dataset** , choose the dataset that you created to store your data.

6.  In the **Transfer config name** section, for **Display name** , enter a name for the data transfer.

7.  In the **Schedule options** section:
    
      - In the **Repeat frequency** list, select an option to specify how often this data transfer runs. To specify a custom repeat frequency, select **Custom** . If you select **On-demand** , then this transfer runs when you [manually trigger the transfer](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .
      - If applicable, select either **Start now** or **Start at set time** , and provide a start date and run time.

8.  Optional: In the **Notification options** section, do the following:
    
      - To enable email notifications, click the **Email notification** toggle. When you enable this option, the transfer administrator receives an email notification when a transfer run fails.
      - To enable [Pub/Sub transfer run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) for this transfer, click the **Pub/Sub notifications** toggle. You can select your [topic](/pubsub/docs/overview#types) name, or you can click **Create a topic** to create one.

9.  Click **Save** .

### bq

Enter the [`  bq mk  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_mk) and supply the transfer creation flag `  --transfer_config  ` :

``` text
bq mk
    --transfer_config
    --project_id=PROJECT_ID
    --data_source=DATA_SOURCE
    --display_name=NAME
    --target_dataset=DATASET
    --params='PARAMETERS'
```

Where:

  - PROJECT\_ID (optional): your Google Cloud project ID. If `  --project_id  ` isn't supplied to specify a particular project, the default project is used.

  - DATA\_SOURCE : the data source — `  salesforce  ` .

  - NAME : the display name for the data transfer configuration. The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.

  - DATASET : the target dataset for the transfer configuration.

  - PARAMETERS : the parameters for the created transfer configuration in JSON format. For example: `  --params='{"param":"param_value"}'  ` . The following are the parameters for a Salesforce data transfer:
    
      - `  connector.authentication.oauth.clientId  ` : the Consumer Key of the Salesforce connected application.
      - `  connector.authentication.oauth.clientSecret  ` : OAuth Client Secret or Consumer Secret of the Salesforce connected application.
      - `  connector.authentication.oauth.myDomain  ` : the [Salesforce My Domain](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.domain_name_overview.htm) . For example, if your domain URL is `  example.my.salesforce.com  ` , then the value is `  example  ` .
      - `  ingestionType  ` : specify either `  FULL  ` or `  INCREMENTAL  ` . Incremental transfers are supported in [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) . For more information, see [Full or incremental transfers](/bigquery/docs/salesforce-transfer#full_or_incremental_transfers) .
      - `  writeMode  ` : specify either `  WRITE_MODE_APPEND  ` or `  WRITE_MODE_UPSERT  ` .
      - `  watermarkColumns  ` : specify columns in your table as watermark columns. This field is required for incremental transfers.
      - `  primaryKeys  ` : specify columns in your table as primary keys. This field is required for incremental transfers.
      - `  assets  ` : the path to the Salesforce objects to be transferred to BigQuery.

When specifying multiple assets during an incremental transfer, the values of the `  watermarkColumns  ` and `  primaryKeys  ` fields correspond to the position of values in the `  assets  ` field. In the following example, `  Id  ` corresponds to the table `  Account  ` , while `  master_label  ` and `  type  ` corresponds to the table `  CaseHistory  ` .

``` text
      "primaryKeys":[['Id'], ['master_label','type']],
      "assets":["Account","CaseHistory"],
  
```

The following command creates an incremental Salesforce data transfer in the default project, and uses the `  APPEND  ` write mode.

``` text
bq mk
    --transfer_config
    --target_dataset=mydataset
    --data_source=salesforce
    --display_name='My Transfer'
    --params='{"assets": ["Account", "CaseHistory"]
        "connector.authentication.oauth.clientId": "1234567890",
        "connector.authentication.oauth.clientSecret":"ABC12345",
        "connector.authentication.oauth.myDomain":"MyDomainName",
        "connector.authentication.username":"user1@force.com",
        "connector.authentication.password":"abcdef1234",
        "ingestionType":"incremental",
        "writeMode":"WRITE_MODE_UPSERT",
        "watermarkColumns":["SystemModstamp","CreatedDate"]
        "primaryKeys":[['Id'], ['master_label','type']]}'
```

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.transferConfigs.create  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create) method and supply an instance of the [`  TransferConfig  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs#TransferConfig) resource.

When you save the transfer configuration, the Salesforce connector automatically triggers a transfer run according to your schedule option. With every transfer run, the Salesforce connector transfers all available data from Salesforce into BigQuery.

To manually run a data transfer outside of your regular schedule, you can start a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .
