In this tutorial, you create an authorized view in BigQuery that is used by your data analysts. [Authorized views](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views) let you share query results with particular users and groups without giving them access to the underlying source data. The view is given access to the source data instead of a user or group. You can also use the view's SQL query to exclude columns and fields from the query results.

An alternative approach to using an authorized view would be to set up column-level access controls on the source data and then give your users access to a view that queries the access-controlled data. For more information on column-level access controls, see [Introduction to column-level access control](/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro) .

If you have multiple authorized views that access the same source dataset, you can [authorize the dataset](/bigquery/docs/authorized-datasets) that contains the views instead of authorizing an individual view.

## Objectives

  - Create a dataset to contain your source data.
  - Run a query to load data into a destination table in the source dataset.
  - Create a dataset to contain your authorized view.
  - Create an authorized view from a SQL query that restricts the columns that your data analysts can see in the query results.
  - Grant your data analysts permission to run query jobs.
  - Grant your data analysts access to the dataset that contains the authorized view.
  - Grant the authorized view access to the source dataset.

## Costs

In this document, you use the following billable components of Google Cloud:

  - [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing)

To generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage, use the [pricing calculator](/products/calculator) .

New Google Cloud users might be eligible for a [free trial](/free) .

When you finish the tasks that are described in this document, you can avoid continued billing by deleting the resources that you created. For more information, see [Clean up](#clean-up) .

## Before you begin

1.  [Verify that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

2.  Enable the BigQuery API.
    
    **Roles required to enable APIs**
    
    To enable APIs, you need the Service Usage Admin IAM role ( `  roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin  ` ), which contains the `  serviceusage.services.enable  ` permission. [Learn how to grant roles](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

3.  Ensure that you have the [necessary permissions](/bigquery/docs/authorized-views#required_permissions) to perform the tasks in this document.

## Create a dataset to store your source data

You begin by creating a dataset to store your source data.

To create your source dataset, choose one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, beside the project where you want to create the dataset, click more\_vert **View actions** \> **Create dataset** .

4.  On the **Create dataset** page, do the following:
    
    1.  For **Dataset ID** , enter `  github_source_data  ` .
    
    2.  For **Location type** , verify that **Multi-region** is selected.
    
    3.  For **Multi-region** , choose **US** or **EU** . All the resources you create in this tutorial should be in the same multi-region location.
    
    4.  Click **Create dataset** .

### SQL

Use the [`  CREATE SCHEMA  ` DDL statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_schema_statement) :

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE SCHEMA github_source_data;
    ```

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

# Specify the geographic location where the dataset should reside.
source_dataset.location = "US"
source_dataset = client.create_dataset(source_dataset)  # API request
```

## Create a table and load your source data

After you create the source dataset, you populate a table in it by saving the results of a SQL query to a destination table. The query retrieves data from the [GitHub public dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=bigquery-public-data&d=github_repos&page=dataset) .

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following query:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      commit,
      author,
      committer,
      repo_name
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.github_repos.commits`
    LIMIT
      1000;
    ```

3.  Click **More** and select **Query settings** .

4.  For **Destination** , select **Set a destination table for query results** .

5.  For **Dataset** , enter `  PROJECT_ID .github_source_data  ` .
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with your project ID.

6.  For **Table Id** , enter `  github_contributors  ` .

7.  Click **Save** .

8.  Click **Run** .

9.  When the query completes, in the **Explorer** pane, click **Datasets** , and then click the **`  github_source_data  `** dataset.

10. Click **Overview \> Tables** , and then click the **`  github_contributors  `** table.

11. To verify the data was written to the table, click the **Preview** tab.

"""
client.query_and_wait(
    sql,
    # Location must match that of the dataset(s) referenced in the query
    # and of the destination table.
    location="US",
    job_config=job_config,
)  # API request - starts the query and waits for query to finish
```

## Create a dataset to store your authorized view

After creating your source dataset, you create a new, separate dataset to store the authorized view that you share with your data analysts. In a later step, you grant the authorized view access to the data in the source dataset. Your data analysts then have access to the authorized view, but not direct access to the source data.

Authorized views should be created in a different dataset from the source data. That way, data owners can give users access to the authorized view without simultaneously granting access to the underlying data. The source data dataset and authorized view dataset must be in the same regional [location](/bigquery/docs/locations) .

To create a dataset to store your view, choose one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, select the project where you want to create the dataset.

4.  Expand the more\_vert **View actions** option and click **Create dataset** .

5.  On the **Create dataset** page, do the following:
    
    1.  For **Dataset ID** , enter `  shared_views  ` .
    
    2.  For **Location type** , verify that **Multi-region** is selected.
    
    3.  For **Multi-region** , choose **US** or **EU** . All the resources you create in this tutorial should be in the same multi-region location.
    
    4.  Click **Create dataset** .

### SQL

Use the [`  CREATE SCHEMA  ` DDL statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_schema_statement) :

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE SCHEMA shared_views;
    ```

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

shared_dataset = bigquery.Dataset(shared_dataset_id_full)
shared_dataset.location = "US"
shared_dataset = client.create_dataset(shared_dataset)  # API request
```

## Create the authorized view in the new dataset

In the new dataset, you create the view you intend to authorize. This is the view you share with your data analysts. This view is created using a SQL query that excludes the columns you don't want the data analysts to see.

The `  github_contributors  ` source table contains two fields of type [`  RECORD  `](/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#define_nested_and_repeated_columns) : `  author  ` and `  committer  ` . For this tutorial, your authorized view excludes all of the author data except for the author's name, and it excludes all of the committer data except for the committer's name.

To create the view in the new dataset, choose one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following query.
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
    commit,
    author.name AS author,
    committer.name AS committer,
    repo_name
    FROM
    `PROJECT_ID.github_source_data.github_contributors`;
    ```
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with your project ID.

3.  Click **Save** \> **Save view** .

4.  In the **Save view** dialog, do the following:
    
    1.  For **Project** , verify your project is selected.
    
    2.  For **Dataset** , enter `  shared_views  ` .
    
    3.  For **Table** , enter `  github_analyst_view  ` .
    
    4.  Click **Save** .

### SQL

Use the [`  CREATE VIEW  ` DDL statement](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_view_statement) :

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    CREATE VIEW shared_views.github_analyst_view
    AS (
      SELECT
        commit,
        author.name AS author,
        committer.name AS committer,
        repo_name
      FROM
        `PROJECT_ID.github_source_data.github_contributors`
    );
    ```
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with your project ID.

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

### Java

Before trying this sample, follow the Java setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Java API reference documentation](/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-bigquery/latest/overview) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

``` java
// Create the view in the new dataset
String viewQuery =
    String.format(
        "SELECT commit, author.name as author, committer.name as committer, repo_name FROM %s.%s.%s",
        projectId, sourceDatasetId, sourceTableId);

ViewDefinition viewDefinition = ViewDefinition.of(viewQuery);

Table view =
    bigquery.create(TableInfo.of(TableId.of(sharedDatasetId, sharedViewId), viewDefinition));
```

### Python

Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Python API reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

``` python
shared_view_id = "github_analyst_view"
view = bigquery.Table(shared_dataset.table(shared_view_id))
sql_template = """
    SELECT
        commit, author.name as author,
        committer.name as committer, repo_name
    FROM
        `{}.{}.{}`
"""
view.view_query = sql_template.format(
    client.project, source_dataset_id, source_table_id
)
view = client.create_table(view)  # API request
```

## Grant your data analysts permission to run query jobs

To query the view, your data analysts need the `  bigquery.jobs.create  ` permission so they can run query jobs, and they need to be granted access to the view. In this section, you grant the `  bigquery.user  ` role to your data analysts. The `  bigquery.user  ` role includes `  bigquery.jobs.create  ` permission. In a later step, you grant your data analysts permission to access the view.

To assign the data analysts group to the `  bigquery.user  ` role at the project level, do the following:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page.

2.  Ensure your project is selected in the project selector.

3.  Click person\_add **Grant access** .

4.  In the **Grant access to** dialog, do the following:
    
    1.  In the **New principals** field, enter the group that contains your data analysts. For example, `  data_analysts@example.com  ` .
    
    2.  In the **Select a role** field, search for the **BigQuery User** role and select it.
    
    3.  Click **Save** .

## Grant your data analysts permission to query the authorized view

For your data analysts to query the view, they need to be granted the `  bigquery.dataViewer  ` role at either the dataset level or the view level. Granting this role at the dataset level gives your analysts access to all tables and views in the dataset. Because the dataset created in this tutorial contains a single authorized view, you're granting access at the dataset level. If you have a collection of authorized views that you need to grant access to, consider using an [authorized dataset](/bigquery/docs/authorized-datasets) instead.

The `  bigquery.user  ` role you granted to your data analysts previously gives them the permissions required to create query jobs. However, they cannot successfully query the view unless they also have `  bigquery.dataViewer  ` access to the authorized view or to the dataset that contains the view.

To give your data analysts `  bigquery.dataViewer  ` access to the dataset that contains the authorized view, do the following:

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, click **Datasets** , and then select the `  shared_views  ` dataset to open the **Details** tab.

4.  Click person\_add **Sharing** \> **Permissions** .

5.  In the **Share permissions** pane, click **Add principal** .

6.  For **New principals** , enter the group that contains your data analysts—for example, `  data_analysts@example.com  ` .

7.  Click **Select a role** and select **BigQuery** \> **BigQuery Data Viewer** .

8.  Click **Save** .

9.  Click **Close** .

### Java

Before trying this sample, follow the Java setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Java API reference documentation](/java/docs/reference/google-cloud-bigquery/latest/overview) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

``` java
// Assign access controls to the dataset containing the view
List<Acl> viewAcl = new ArrayList<>(sharedDataset.getAcl());
viewAcl.add(Acl.of(new Acl.Group("example-analyst-group@google.com"), Acl.Role.READER));
sharedDataset.toBuilder().setAcl(viewAcl).build().update();
```

### Python

Before trying this sample, follow the Python setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Python API reference documentation](/python/docs/reference/bigquery/latest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

``` python
# analyst_group_email = 'data_analysts@example.com'
access_entries = shared_dataset.access_entries
access_entries.append(
    bigquery.AccessEntry("READER", EntityTypes.GROUP_BY_EMAIL, analyst_group_email)
)
shared_dataset.access_entries = access_entries
shared_dataset = client.update_dataset(
    shared_dataset, ["access_entries"]
)  # API request
```

## Authorize the view to access the source dataset

After you create access controls for the dataset that contains the authorized view, you grant the authorized view access to the source dataset. This authorization gives the view, but not your data analysts group, access to the source data.

To grant the authorized view access the source data, choose one of these options:

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, click **Datasets** , and then select the `  github_source_data  ` dataset to open the **Details** tab.

4.  Click **Sharing** \> **Authorize views** .

5.  In the **Authorized views** pane, for **Authorized view** enter `  PROJECT_ID .shared_views.github_analyst_view  ` .
    
    Replace PROJECT\_ID with your project ID.

6.  Click **Add authorization** .

)
source_dataset.access_entries = access_entries
source_dataset = client.update_dataset(
    source_dataset, ["access_entries"]
)  # API request
```

## Verify the configuration

When your configuration is complete, a member of your data analysts group (for example, `  data_analysts  ` ) can verify the configuration by querying the view.

To verify the configuration, a data analyst should run the following query:

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the query editor, enter the following statement:
    
    ``` text
    SELECT
      *
    FROM
      `PROJECT_ID.shared_views.github_analyst_view`;
    ```
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with your project ID.

3.  Click play\_circle **Run** .

The query results are similar to the following. Only the author name and committer name are visible in the results.

## Clean up

To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and delete the individual resources.

### Delete the project

### Console

**Caution** : Deleting a project has the following effects:

  - **Everything in the project is deleted.** If you used an existing project for the tasks in this document, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
  - **Custom project IDs are lost.** When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an `  appspot.com  ` URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.

If you plan to explore multiple architectures, tutorials, or quickstarts, reusing projects can help you avoid exceeding project quota limits.

In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Manage resources** page.

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click **Delete** .

In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click **Shut down** to delete the project.

### Delete individual resources

Alternatively, to remove the individual resources used in this tutorial, do the following:

1.  [Delete the authorized view](/bigquery/docs/managing-views#delete_views) .

2.  [Delete the dataset](/bigquery/docs/managing-datasets#delete-datasets) that contains the authorized view.

3.  [Delete the table](/bigquery/docs/managing-tables#deleting_a_table) in the source dataset.

4.  [Delete the source dataset](/bigquery/docs/managing-datasets#delete-datasets) .

Because you created the resources used in this tutorial, no additional permissions are required to delete them.
