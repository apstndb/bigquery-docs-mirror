# Schedule data preparations

This document describes how to schedule data preparation pipelines and perform manual runs.

Data preparations are powered by [Dataform](/dataform/docs/overview) . Each data preparation schedule is run using your Google Account user credentials or a [custom service account](/dataform/docs/access-control#about-service-accounts) that you select when you configure the schedule or test run.

Changes you make to the data preparation steps aren't automatically saved. You must save and deploy the changes before they can be executed with a schedule. Schedules always run the latest deployed version of your data preparation and exclude any undeployed changes you might be developing.

## Before you begin

Before you begin, [create a data preparation](/bigquery/docs/data-prep-get-suggestions) .

### Required roles

To authorize a data preparation with a service account when [manually running the data preparation in development](#run-undeployed-manually) or [scheduling the data preparation](#create-schedule) , you must grant roles to the service account that you plan to use for executing the data preparation runs. For more information, see [Give access to the Dataform service account](/bigquery/docs/manage-data-preparations#dataform-service-account-iam) .

Before scheduling data preparations with a custom service account, do the following:

  - Ask your administrator to grant you the [Service Account User role](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountUser) ( `  roles/iam.serviceAccountUser  ` ) on the custom service account.
  - Grant the [Service Account User role](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountUser) ( `  roles/iam.serviceAccountUser  ` ) and the [Service Account Token Creator role](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/iam#iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator) ( `  roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator  ` ) to the default Dataform service agent on the custom service account.

To enhance security for scheduling, see [Implement enhanced scheduling permissions](/dataform/docs/access-control#enhanced-scheduling-permissions) .

## Develop a data preparation

As you develop a data preparation, you can manually run the steps and inspect the output before you deploy the changes to production. You can test the current version you're developing on your data, while BigQuery continues to run the latest deployed version, according to a [schedule](#create-schedule) . Before you can perform the run, you must [configure the destination](/bigquery/docs/data-prep-get-suggestions#add-or-change-destination) , and fix any validation errors.

### Manually run a data preparation in development

To test your data preparation steps and validate the results in your destination table, run the data preparation manually from the data preparation editor:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Data preparations** .

4.  Click the name of the data preparation that you want to run.

5.  In the data preparation editor toolbar, click **More \> Configure run now experience** .

6.  In the **Authentication** section, authorize the data preparation with your Google Account user credentials or a service account.
    
      - To use your Google Account user credentials ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ), select **Execute with my user credentials** . This is the default option.
      - To use a service account, select **Execute with selected service account** , and then select a service account. If the service account needs additional permissions, grant it the required roles by clicking **Grant all** .

7.  Click **Save** .

8.  Fix any validation errors that appear.

9.  From the data preparation editor toolbar, click **Run** .

10. In the **Run now** dialog, click **Confirm** to acknowledge that this manual run writes data to a destination table, which you might also be using for scheduled runs.
    
    If you selected **Execute with my user credentials** for your authentication method, you must [authorize your Google Account](#authorize-google-account) ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ).
    
    The run then executes your steps and loads the output to the destination.

11. Optional: After the run is complete, you can view the details about the execution in the **Executions** pane.

## Deploy a data preparation

To schedule runs for a version of your data preparation, you must first deploy it. Schedules run the most recently deployed version.

To deploy a data preparation, follow these steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Data preparations** .

4.  Click the name of the chosen data preparation.
    
    The data preparation editor opens.

5.  In the data preparation editor toolbar, click **Deploy** .

## Create a schedule

To create a schedule that executes the deployed data preparation steps and loads the prepared data into the destination table, you must first schedule a data preparation run. To schedule the run, you must [configure the destination](/bigquery/docs/data-prep-get-suggestions#add-or-change-destination) , and fix any validation errors.

To create a data preparation schedule, follow these steps:

### **Explorer** pane

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project and click **Data preparations** .

4.  Click the name of the data preparation that you want to schedule.

5.  From the data preparation editor toolbar, click **Schedule** .

6.  Enter a schedule name.

7.  In the **Authentication** section, authorize the data preparation with your Google Account user credentials or a service account.
    
      - To use your Google Account user credentials ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ), select **Execute with my user credentials** .
      - To use a service account, select **Execute with selected service account** , and then select a service account.

8.  Schedule a frequency.

9.  Click **Create schedule** . If you selected **Execute with my user credentials** for your authentication method, you must [authorize your Google Account](#authorize-google-account) ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ).

### **Scheduling** page

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **Scheduling** page.

2.  Click **Create** , and then select **Data Preparation schedule** from the menu.

3.  In the **Schedule data preparation** pane, in the **Data preparation** field, select the data preparation that you want to schedule.

4.  In the **Schedule name** field, enter a name for the schedule.

5.  In the **Authentication** section, authorize the data preparation with your Google Account user credentials or a service account.
    
      - To use your Google Account user credentials ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ), select **Execute with my user credentials** .
      - To use a service account, select **Execute with selected service account** , and then select a service account.

6.  In the **Schedule frequency** section, do the following:
    
    1.  In the **Repeats** menu, select the frequency of data preparation runs.
    2.  In the **At time** field, enter the time for scheduled data preparation runs.
    3.  In the **Timezone** menu, select the timezone for the schedule.

7.  Click **Create schedule** . If you selected **Execute with my user credentials** for your authentication method, you must [authorize your Google Account](#authorize-google-account) ( [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages) ).

To authenticate the resource with your [Google Account](/iam/docs/principals-overview#google-account) user credentials, you must manually grant permission for BigQuery pipelines to get the access token for your Google Account and access the source data on your behalf. You can grant manual approval with the OAuth dialog interface.

You only need to give permission to BigQuery pipelines once.

To revoke the permission that you granted, follow these steps:

1.  Go to your [Google Account page](https://myaccount.google.com/) .
2.  Click **BigQuery Pipelines** .
3.  Click **Remove access** .

**Warning:** Revoking access permissions prevents any future pipeline runs that this Google Account owns across all regions.

Changing the data preparation schedule owner by updating credentials also requires manual approval if the new Google Account owner has never created a schedule before.
