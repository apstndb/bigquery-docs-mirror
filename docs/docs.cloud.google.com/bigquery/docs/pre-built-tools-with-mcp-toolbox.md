# Connect LLMs to BigQuery with MCP

**Note:** MCP Toolbox for Databases is in beta (pre-v1.0) and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This guide shows you how to use the [MCP Toolbox for Databases](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox) to connect your BigQuery project to a variety of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and developer tools. It uses the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) , an open protocol for connecting large language models (LLMs) to data sources like BigQuery, allowing you to run SQL queries and interact with your project directly from your existing tools.

If you use the Gemini CLI, you can use BigQuery extensions. To learn how, see [Develop with Gemini CLI](/bigquery/docs/develop-with-gemini-cli) . If you plan to build custom tools for the Gemini CLI, continue reading.

This guide demonstrates the connection process for the following IDEs:

  - Cursor
  - Windsurf (formerly Codeium)
  - Visual Studio Code (Copilot)
  - Cline (VS Code extension)
  - Claude desktop
  - Claude code
  - Antigravity

## Before you begin

1.  In the Google Cloud console, on the [project selector page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard) , select or create a Google Cloud project.

2.  [Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project](/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project) .

3.  [Enable the BigQuery API in the Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=bigquery.googleapis.com&redirect=https://console.cloud.google.com/) .

4.  Configure the required roles and permissions to complete this task. You will need the [BigQuery User](/bigquery/docs/access-control) role ( `  roles/bigquery.user  ` ), the BigQuery Data Viewer role ( `  roles/bigquery.dataViewer  ` ), or equivalent IAM permissions to connect to the project.

5.  Configure [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment) for your environment.

## Connect with Antigravity

You can connect BigQuery to Antigravity in the following ways:

  - Using the MCP Store
  - Using a custom configuration

**Note:** You don't need to download the MCP Toolbox binary to use these methods.

### MCP Store

The most straightforward way to connect to BigQuery in Antigravity is by using the built-in MCP Store.

1.  Open [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp) and open the **editor's agent panel** .
2.  Click the **"..."** icon at the top of the panel and select **MCP Servers** .
3.  Locate **BigQuery** in the list of available servers and click **Install** .
4.  Follow the on-screen prompts to securely link your accounts where applicable.

After you install BigQuery in the MCP Store, resources and tools from the server are automatically available to the editor.

### Custom config

To connect to a custom MCP server, follow these steps:

1.  Open [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp) and navigate to the MCP store using the **"..."** drop-down at the top of the editor's agent panel.
2.  To open the **mcp\_config.json** file, click **MCP Servers** and then click **Manage MCP Servers \> View raw config** .
3.  Add the following configuration, replace the environment variable with your values, and save.

<!-- end list -->

``` text
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bigquery": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y","@toolbox-sdk/server","--prebuilt","bigquery","--stdio"],
      "env": {
          "BIGQUERY_PROJECT": "PROJECT_ID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Install the MCP Toolbox

You don't need to install MCP Toolbox if you only plan to use the BigQuery Gemini CLI extensions, as they bundle the required server capabilities. For other IDEs and tools, follow the steps in this section to install MCP Toolbox.

The toolbox acts as an open-source [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that sits between your IDE and BigQuery, providing a secure and efficient control plane for your AI tools.

1.  Download the latest version of the MCP Toolbox as a binary. Select the [binary](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox/releases) corresponding to your operating system (OS) and CPU architecture. You must use MCP Toolbox version V0.7.0 or later:
    
    ### linux/amd64
    
    ``` text
    curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/VERSION/linux/amd64/toolbox
    ```
    
    Replace `  VERSION  ` with the MCP Toolbox version—for example `  v0.7.0  ` .
    
    ### macOS darwin/arm64
    
    ``` text
    curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/VERSION/darwin/arm64/toolbox
    ```
    
    Replace `  VERSION  ` with the MCP Toolbox version—for example `  v0.7.0  ` .
    
    ### macOS darwin/amd64
    
    ``` text
    curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/VERSION/darwin/amd64/toolbox
    ```
    
    Replace `  VERSION  ` with the MCP Toolbox version—for example `  v0.7.0  ` .
    
    ### windows/amd64
    
    ``` text
    curl -O https://storage.googleapis.com/genai-toolbox/VERSION/windows/amd64/toolbox
    ```
    
    Replace `  VERSION  ` with the MCP Toolbox version—for example `  v0.7.0  ` .

2.  Make the binary executable:
    
    ``` text
    chmod +x toolbox
    ```

3.  Verify the installation:
    
    ``` text
    ./toolbox --version
    ```

## Set up clients and connections

This section explains how to connect BigQuery to your tools.

If you are using the standalone Gemini CLI, you don't need to install or configure MCP Toolbox, as the extensions bundle the required server capabilities.

For other MCP-compatible tools and IDEs, you must first [install MCP Toolbox](#install) .

### Claude code
