## Data ingestion from Search Ads 360 transfers

When you transfer data from Search Ads 360 into BigQuery, the data is loaded into BigQuery tables that are partitioned by date. The table partition that the data is loaded into corresponds to the date from the data source. If you schedule multiple transfers for the same date, BigQuery Data Transfer Service overwrites the partition for that specific date with the latest data. Multiple transfers in the same day or running backfills don't result in duplicate data, and partitions for other dates are not affected.

### Refresh windows

A *refresh window* is the number of days that a data transfer retrieves data when a data transfer occurs. For example, if the refresh window is three days and a daily transfer occurs, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service retrieves all data from your source table from the past three days. In this example, when a daily transfer occurs, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service creates a new BigQuery destination table partition with a copy of your source table data from the current day, then automatically triggers backfill runs to update the BigQuery destination table partitions with your source table data from the past two days. The automatically triggered backfill runs will either overwrite or incrementally update your BigQuery destination table, depending on whether or not incremental updates are supported in the BigQuery Data Transfer Service connector.

When you run a data transfer for the first time, the data transfer retrieves all source data available within the refresh window. For example, if the refresh window is three days and you run the data transfer for the first time, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service retrieves all source data within three days.

To retrieve data outside the refresh window, such as historical data, or to recover data from any transfer outages or gaps, you can initiate or schedule a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .

## Limitations

  - The maximum frequency that you can configure a Search Ads 360 data transfer for is once every 24 hours. By default, a transfer starts at the time that you create the transfer. However, you can configure the data transfer start time when you [create your transfer](/bigquery/docs/search-ads-transfer#setup-data-transfer) .
  - The BigQuery Data Transfer Service does not support incremental data transfers during a Search Ads 360 transfer. When you specify a date for a data transfer, all of the data that is available for that date is transferred.

## Before you begin

Before you create a Search Ads 360 data transfer:

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store the Search Ads 360 reporting data.
  - If you intend to setup transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, you must have `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` permissions. Pub/Sub permissions are not required if you just set up email notifications. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .
  - [Enable access](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/searchads360.googleapis.com/) to the Search Ads 360 reporting API in your project.

## Required permissions

Ensure that you have granted the following permissions.

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

3.  In the **Source type** section, for **Source** , choose **Search Ads 360** .

4.  In the **Transfer config name** section, for **Display name** , enter a name for the data transfer such as `  My Transfer  ` . The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.

5.  In the **Schedule options** section:
    
      - For **Repeat frequency** , choose an option for how often to run the data transfer. If you select **Days** , provide a valid time in UTC.
      - If applicable, select either **Start now** or **Start at set time** , and provide a start date and run time.

6.  In the **Destination settings** section, for **Dataset** , select the dataset that you created to store your data.

7.  In the **Data source details** section:
    
    1.  For **Customer ID** , enter your Search Ads 360 customer ID.
    
    2.  Optional: Enter both an **Agency ID** and **Advertiser ID** to retrieve [ID mapping tables](/bigquery/docs/search-ads-transfer#id-mapping) .
    
    3.  Optional: For **Custom Floodlight Variables** , enter any [custom Floodlight variables](https://support.google.com/sa360/answer/13567857) to include in the data transfer. The custom floodlight variables must be owned by the Search Ads 360 account that is specified by the Customer ID in the transfer config. This parameter takes string inputs in JSON array format and can support multiple custom Floodlight variables. In each item of the JSON array, the following parameters are required:
        
          - `  id  ` : the numeric ID of the custom Floodlight variable. This ID is assigned when [a custom Floodlight variable is created in Search Ads 360](https://support.google.com/sa360/answer/14316155) . If you have specified an `  id  ` , then a `  name  ` isn't required.
          - `  name  ` : the user-defined name of the custom floodlight variables in Search Ads 360. If you have specified a `  name  ` , then an `  id  ` isn't required.
          - `  cfv_field_name  ` : the exact custom Floodlight variable field name based on your use case. The supported values are `  conversion_custom_metrics  ` , `  conversion_custom_dimensions  ` , `  raw_event_conversion_metrics  ` , and `  raw_event_conversion_dimensions  ` .
          - `  destination_table_name  ` : a list of BigQuery tables to include the custom floodlight variables in. When the BigQuery Data Transfer Service retrieves data for these tables, the transfer includes the custom Floodlight variables in the query.
          - `  bigquery_column_name_suffix  ` : the user-defined friendly column name. The BigQuery Data Transfer Service appends the suffix after the standard field name to differentiate different custom Floodlight variables. Depending on the use case, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service generates a BigQuery column name as follows:
        
        <table>
        <thead>
        <tr class="header">

    </table>

**Caution:** You cannot configure notifications using the command-line tool.

For example, the following command creates a Search Ads 360 data transfer named `  My Transfer  ` using Customer ID `  6828088731  ` and target dataset `  mydataset  ` . The transfer also specifies a custom floodlight variable. The data transfer is created in the default project:

``` text
bq mk \
--transfer_config \
--target_dataset=mydataset \
--display_name='My Transfer' \
--data_source=search_ads \
--params='{"customer_id":"6828088731", "custom_floodlight_variables":"[{\"id\": \"9876\", \"cfv_field_name\": \"raw_event_conversion_metrics\", \"destination_table_name\": [\"Conversion\"],\"bigquery_column_name_suffix\": \"suffix1\" }]"}'
```

The first time you run the command, you receive a message like the following:

`  [URL omitted] Please copy and paste the above URL into your web browser and follow the instructions to retrieve an authentication code.  `

Follow the instructions in the message and paste the authentication code on the command line.

**Caution:** When you create a Search Ads 360 data transfer using the command-line tool, the transfer configuration is set up using the default values for **Schedule** (every 24 hours at creation time) and **Refresh window** (0 — configures the default refresh window of 7 days).

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.transferConfigs.create  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create) method and supply an instance of the [`  TransferConfig  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs#TransferConfig) resource.

## Performance Max (PMax) campaigns

The Search Ads 360 connector lets you export [PMax campaigns](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10724817) data. You must select the **Include PMax Campaign Data** checkbox when [creating a data transfer](#setup-data-transfer) , as PMax data is not exported by default.

Including PMax data removes `  ad_group  ` fields from certain tables and includes new tables. You cannot include `  ad_group  ` fields because the Search Ads 360 API filters the PMax data.

The following tables exclude `  ad_group  ` related columns when the **Include PMax Campaign Tables** checkbox is selected:

  - CartDataSalesStats
  - ProductAdvertised
  - ProductAdvertisedDeviceStats
  - ProductAdvertisedConversionActionAndDeviceStats

## Support for Search Ads 360 manager accounts

Using Search Ads 360 manager accounts provides several benefits over using individual Customer IDs:

  - You don't need to manage multiple data transfers to report on multiple Customer IDs.
  - Cross-customer queries are simpler to write because all Customer IDs are stored in the same table.
  - Using manager accounts alleviates BigQuery Data Transfer Service load quota issues because multiple Customer IDs are loaded in the same job.

For existing customers who have multiple Customer ID-specific Search Ads 360 data transfers, we recommend that you switch to a Search Ads 360 manager account instead. You can do this with the following steps:

1.  Set up a single Search Ads 360 data transfer at the manager or sub-manager account level.
2.  [Schedule a backfill.](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer)
3.  [Disable](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#disable_a_transfer) individual Customer ID-specific Search Ads 360 transfers.

For more information about Search Ads 360 manager accounts, see [About manager accounts in the new Search Ads 360](https://support.google.com/sa360/answer/9158072) and [See how accounts are linked to your manager account](https://support.google.com/sa360/answer/9227233) .

**Note:** The BigQuery Data Transfer Service pulls reports for all listed Customer IDs, but you may not see Customer IDs in your reports if it doesn't report activity for the requested day.

### Example

The following list shows the Customer IDs linked to particular Search Ads 360 manager accounts:

  - 1234567890 — root manager account
      - 1234 — sub-manager account
          - 1111 — Customer ID
          - 2222 — Customer ID
          - 3333 — Customer ID
          - 4444 — Customer ID
          - 567 — sub-manager account
              - 5555 — Customer ID
              - 6666 — Customer ID
              - 7777 — Customer ID
      - 89 — sub-manager account
          - 8888 — Customer ID
          - 9999 — Customer ID
      - 0000 — Customer ID

Each Customer ID is linked to a manager account appears in each report. For more information about the Search Ads 360 reporting structure in BigQuery Data Transfer Service, see [Search Ads 360 report transformation](/bigquery/docs/search-ads-transformation) .

## Query your data

When your data is transferred to BigQuery Data Transfer Service, the data is written to ingestion-time partitioned tables. For more information, see [Introduction to partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/partitioned-tables) .

If you query your tables directly instead of using the auto-generated views, you must use the `  _PARTITIONTIME  ` pseudocolumn in your query. For more information, see [Querying partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) .

## Search Ads 360 sample queries

You can use the following Search Ads 360 sample queries to analyze your transferred data. You can also view the queries in a visualization tool such as [Looker Studio](https://cloud.google.com/looker-studio) .

The following queries are examples to get started querying your Search Ads 360 data with BigQuery Data Transfer Service. For additional questions about what you can do with these reports, contact your Search Ads 360 technical representative.

If you query your tables directly instead of using the auto-generated views, you must use the `  _PARTITIONTIME  ` pseudocolumn in your query. For more information, see [Querying partitioned tables](/bigquery/docs/querying-partitioned-tables) .

### Campaign performance

The following sample query analyzes Search Ads 360 campaign performance for the past 30 days.

``` text
SELECT
  c.customer_id,
  c.campaign_name,
  c.campaign_status,
  SUM(cs.metrics_clicks) AS Clicks,
  (SUM(cs.metrics_cost_micros) / 1000000) AS Cost,
  SUM(cs.metrics_impressions) AS Impressions
FROM
  `DATASET.sa_Campaign_CUSTOMER_ID` c
LEFT JOIN
  `DATASET.sa_CampaignStats_CUSTOMER_ID` cs
ON
  (c.campaign_id = cs.campaign_id
  AND cs._DATA_DATE BETWEEN
  DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -31 DAY) AND DATE_ADD(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL -1 DAY))
WHERE
  c._DATA_DATE = c._LATEST_DATE
GROUP BY
  1, 2, 3
ORDER BY
  Impressions DESC
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the dataset
  - `  CUSTOMER_ID  ` : the Search Ads 360 customer ID

### Count of keywords

The following sample query analyzes keywords by campaign, ad group, and keyword status.

``` text
  SELECT
    c.campaign_status AS CampaignStatus,
    a.ad_group_status AS AdGroupStatus,
    k.ad_group_criterion_status AS KeywordStatus,
    k.ad_group_criterion_keyword_match_type AS KeywordMatchType,
    COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM
    `DATASET.sa_Keyword_CUSTOMER_ID` k
    JOIN
    `DATASET.sa_Campaign_CUSTOMER_ID` c
  ON
    (k.campaign_id = c.campaign_id AND k._DATA_DATE = c._DATA_DATE)
  JOIN
    `DATASET.sa_AdGroup_CUSTOMER_ID` a
  ON
    (k.ad_group_id = a.ad_group_id AND k._DATA_DATE = a._DATA_DATE)
  WHERE
    k._DATA_DATE = k._LATEST_DATE
  GROUP BY
    1, 2, 3, 4
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the dataset
  - `  CUSTOMER_ID  ` : the Search Ads 360 customer ID

## ID mapping tables

Entities in the new Search Ads 360, such as customers, campaigns, and ad groups, have a different [ID space](https://developers.google.com/search-ads/v2/how-tos/reporting/id-mapping) than the old Search Ads 360. For existing Search Ads 360 transfer users who want to combine data from the old Search Ads 360 with the new Search Ads 360 API, you can use the BigQuery Data Transfer Service to transfer ID mapping tables if you provide a valid agency ID and advertiser ID in the transfer configuration.

[Supported entities](https://developers.google.com/search-ads/v2/how-tos/reporting/id-mapping) contain two columns, `  legacy_id  ` and `  new_id  ` , which specifies the ID mapping for entities in old and new versions of Search Ads 360 respectively. For the AD, CAMPAIGN\_CRITERION, and CRITERION entities, a `  new_secondary_id  ` is also provided as these entities [don't have globally unique ids in the new Search Ads 360](https://developers.google.com/search-ads/v2/how-tos/reporting/id-mapping#object-id-uniqueness) . The following is a list of ID mapping tables.

  - IdMapping\_AD
  - IdMapping\_AD\_GROUP
  - IdMapping\_CAMPAIGN
  - IdMapping\_CAMPAIGN\_CRITERION
  - IdMapping\_CAMPAIGN\_GROUP
  - IdMapping\_CAMPAIGN\_GROUP\_PERFORMANCE\_TARGET
  - IdMapping\_CRITERION
  - IdMapping\_CUSTOMER
  - IdMapping\_FEED\_ITEM
  - IdMapping\_FEED\_TABLE

**Note:** Similar to match tables, snapshots of ID mapping tables are taken once a day and stored in the partition for the latest run date. ID mapping table snapshots are not updated for backfills or for days loaded using the refresh window.

### Example queries

The following query makes use of ID mapping tables to aggregate per-campaign metrics across tables from previous and new Search Ads 360 data transfers in the new ID space.

``` text
SELECT CustomerID, CampaignID, Sum(Clicks), Sum(Cost) FROM
(SELECT
  cs.customer_id AS CustomerID,
  cs.campaign_id AS CampaignID,
  cs.metrics_clicks AS Clicks,
  cs.metrics_cost_micros / 1000000 AS Cost
FROM
  `DATASET.sa_CampaignStats_CUSTOMER_ID` cs
WHERE cs._DATA_DATE = 'NEW_DATA_DATE'
UNION ALL
SELECT
  customer_id_mapping.new_id AS CustomerID,
  campaign_id_mapping.new_id AS CampaignID,
  cs.clicks AS Clicks,
  cs.cost AS Cost
FROM
  `DATASET.CampaignStats_ADVERTISER_ID` cs
LEFT JOIN
  `DATASET.IdMapping_CUSTOMER_ADVERTISER_ID` customer_id_mapping
ON cs.accountId = customer_id_mapping.legacy_id
LEFT JOIN
  `DATASET.IdMapping_CAMPAIGN_ADVERTISER_ID` campaign_id_mapping
ON cs.campaignId = campaign_id_mapping.legacy_id
WHERE cs._DATA_DATE = 'OLD_DATA_DATE')
GROUP BY
1, 2
ORDER BY
1, 2
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the dataset
  - `  CUSTOMER_ID  ` : the Search Ads 360 customer ID
  - `  ADVERTISER_ID  ` : the Search Ads 360 advertiser ID
  - `  NEW_DATA_DATE  ` : the data date for the new Search Ads 360 table
  - `  OLD_DATA_DATE  ` : the data date for the previous Search Ads 360 table

The following query makes use of ID mapping tables to aggregate per-campaign metrics across tables from previous and new Search Ads 360 data transfers in the old ID space.

``` text
SELECT CustomerID, CampaignID, Sum(Clicks), Sum(Cost) FROM
(SELECT
  customer_id_mapping.legacy_id AS CustomerID,
  campaign_id_mapping.legacy_id AS CampaignID,
  cs.metrics_clicks AS Clicks,
  cs.metrics_cost_micros / 1000000 AS Cost
FROM
  `DATASET.sa_CampaignStats_CUSTOMER_ID` cs
LEFT JOIN
  `DATASET.IdMapping_CUSTOMER_ADVERTISER_ID` customer_id_mapping
ON cs.customer_id = customer_id_mapping.new_id
LEFT JOIN
  `DATASET.IdMapping_CAMPAIGN_ADVERTISER_ID` campaign_id_mapping
ON cs.campaign_id = campaign_id_mapping.new_id
WHERE cs._DATA_DATE = 'NEW_DATA_DATE'
UNION ALL
SELECT
  CAST(accountId AS INT) AS CustomerID,
  CAST(campaignId AS INT) AS CampaignID,
  cs.clicks AS Clicks,
  cs.cost AS Cost
FROM
  `DATASET.CampaignStats_ADVERTISER_ID` cs
WHERE cs._DATA_DATE = 'OLD_DATA_DATE')
GROUP BY
1, 2
ORDER BY
1, 2
```

Replace the following:

  - `  DATASET  ` : the name of the dataset
  - `  CUSTOMER_ID  ` : the Search Ads 360 customer ID
  - `  ADVERTISER_ID  ` : the Search Ads 360 advertiser ID
  - `  NEW_DATA_DATE  ` : the data date for the new Search Ads 360 table
  - `  OLD_DATA_DATE  ` : the data date for the previous Search Ads 360 table

## Potential quota issues

The Search Ads 360 reporting API assigns a [quota](https://developers.google.com/search-ads/reporting/concepts/quotas#query_limits) for the number of requests that the Google project can send. If you are using one project for the BigQuery Data Transfer Service and other services, all services share the same quota and can potentially reach the quota limit in any service.

To prevent this potential issue without affecting existing workflows, consider these options:

  - Use the `  table_filter  ` parameter to load only the tables that are needed.

  - Set up a separate project for the BigQuery Data Transfer Service. A cross project table join might look like the following:
    
    ``` text
      #standardSQL
      select count(a.item1)
      from (select item1, item2 from project-A.data_set_a.table_name_a) a
      inner join
      (select item3, item4 from project-B.data_set_b.table_name_b) b
      on a.item1 = b.item3
    ```

  - Contact [Search Ads 360 support](https://support.google.com/searchads/answer/9026876) and request additional quota.
