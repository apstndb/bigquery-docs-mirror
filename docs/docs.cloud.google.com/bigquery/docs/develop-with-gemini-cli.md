# Analyze data with the Gemini CLI

**Note:** The BigQuery CLI extensions are based on MCP Toolbox for Databases. MCP Toolbox for Databases is in beta (pre-v1.0) and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

This page explains how to interact with BigQuery data in your terminal by using natural-language prompts with the [Gemini CLI](/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli) . Using the dedicated BigQuery [extensions](#about-bigquery-extensions) with the Gemini CLI enables AI-driven data analysis and insights directly within your command line. You can analyze data from your BigQuery tables, or from tables in the BigQuery public datasets.

These first-party extensions provide some common tools for data analysis and insights. To build your own tools, see [Use BigQuery with MCP, Gemini CLI, and other agents](/bigquery/docs/pre-built-tools-with-mcp-toolbox) .

## About Gemini CLI and extensions

The Gemini CLI is an open-source conversational AI agent from Google that accelerates development workflows and assists with coding, debugging, data exploration, and content creation. It offers an agent-driven experience to interact with Data Cloud services, such as BigQuery, and other popular Google Cloud databases and open-source databases.

For more information about the Gemini CLI, see the [Gemini CLI documentation](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/README.md) .

### How extensions work

Extensions expand the capabilities of the Gemini CLI, letting it connect to and control specific Google Cloud services and other tools. The extensions provide Gemini with context and API understanding, enabling conversational interaction. You can load the extensions from GitHub URLs, local directories, or registries. These extensions offer tools, slash commands, and prompts. These are separate from IDE extensions, such as Gemini Code Assist, which integrate using the MCP Toolbox.

## About the BigQuery extensions

BigQuery offers the following extensions to work with BigQuery data through the Gemini CLI:

  - BigQuery Data Analytics extension  
    Use this extension to discover data, learn more about BigQuery tables and datasets, and ask natural language questions about your datasets. You can also generate forecasts or run a contribution analysis using built-in advanced tools. The tools in this extension help the Gemini CLI write SQL queries based on your natural language questions, and then execute the queries to provide answers for your questions.
  - BigQuery Conversational Analytics extension  
    Use this extension to get advanced insights from your BigQuery data using a pre-hosted, server-side analytics agent. The tools in this extension help the Gemini CLI send your natural language question to a built-in, hosted agent and respond with deeper insights from your data.

  - Use the Conversational Analytics extension: [Gemini for Google Cloud User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/cloudaicompanion#cloudaicompanion.user) ( `  roles/cloudaicompanion.user  ` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

## Install the BigQuery extensions

Install the BigQuery extensions and then use them to explore and analyze your data.

1.  [Install the Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) .

2.  Set the environment variables to connect to your BigQuery project:
    
    ``` text
    export BIGQUERY_PROJECT="PROJECT_ID"
    ```
    
    Replace `  PROJECT_ID  ` with your Google Cloud project ID.
    
    You can also set these optional environment variables:
    
      - `  BIGQUERY_LOCATION  ` : the dataset location—for example: `  export BIGQUERY_LOCATION="us"  `
      - `  BIGQUERY_USE_CLIENT_OAUTH  ` : whether to use client-side OAuth—for example: `  export BIGQUERY_USE_CLIENT_OAUTH=true  `

3.  Install the BigQuery Data Analytics or Conversational Analytics extension using the `  gemini extension install  ` command:
    
      - Optional: install the BigQuery Data Analytics extension:
        
        ``` text
        gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/bigquery-data-analytics
        ```
    
      - Optional: install the BigQuery Conversational Analytics extension:
        
        ``` text

### Run deeper insights using the `     ask_data_insights    ` tool

The `  ask_data_insights  ` tool triggers an agent on the BigQuery Conversational Analytics API to answer your questions. The server-side agent gathers additional context about your data and offers more insights.

  - **Example prompt** to get insights on channels to focus on:
    
    ``` text
    Using ask_data_insights and using the tables under
    bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample, tell me the channels I should
    focus on and why
    ```
    
    **Example response**
    
    The Gemini CLI returns recommendations based on the analysis:
    
    ``` text
    Based on the analysis of the Google Analytics sample data, here are the
    channels you should focus on and why:
    
    |     Channel      | Total Visits | Total Pageviews | Total Transactions | Total Revenue |
    | ---------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
    | Referral         |      104,838 |         707,597 |              5,543 |   $651,429.91 |
    | Direct           |      143,026 |         584,840 |              2,219 |   $434,840.55 |
    | Organic Search   |      381,561 |       1,569,218 |              3,581 |   $326,380.51 |
    | Display          |        6,262 |          34,202 |                152 |    $78,337.46 |
    | Paid Search      |       25,326 |         136,060 |                479 |    $43,558.90 |
    | Social           |      226,117 |         398,690 |                131 |     $4,916.54 |
    | Affiliates       |       16,403 |          47,417 |                  9 |       $597.38 |
    | (Other)          |          120 |             442 |                  1 |         $9.99 |
    
      Recommendations:
    
        1.  Prioritize referral traffic:
            *   Why: This is a highly valuable channel. It brings in the most
                revenue and has a high number of transactions, despite not
                having the highest number of visits. This indicates that
                traffic from referrals is highly qualified and converts
                well.
            *   Action: Identify your top referring websites and build
                stronger relationships with them. Look for similar websites
                to partner with.
    
        2.  Nurture your direct traffic:
            *   Why: Direct traffic is your second-highest revenue source.
                These are likely returning customers or people who know your
                brand well.
    ```

### Pricing

There is no additional cost for using metadata tools (such as `  get_dataset_info  ` , `  get_table_info  ` , `  list_dataset_ids  ` , and `  list_table_ids  ` ) or the `  search_catalog  ` tool.

Tools that run queries, including `  execute_sql  ` , `  forecast  ` , and `  analyze_contribution  ` , are billed according to [BigQuery on-demand pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#on_demand_pricing) or [BigQuery capacity pricing](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing#capacity_compute_analysis_pricing) , depending on your project configuration.

During beta (pre-v1.0), the `  ask_data_insights  ` tool is offered at no additional cost; however, any BigQuery queries that this tool triggers are billed according to standard BigQuery pricing.
