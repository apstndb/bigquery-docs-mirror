# Set permissions for generative AI functions that call Vertex AI LLMs

This document shows you how to set up permissions for running generative AI queries. Generative AI queries contain `  AI.*  ` functions that call foundation models in Vertex AI; for example, `  AI.GENERATE  ` .

There are two ways to set up permissions to run queries that use `  AI.*  ` functions:

  - Run the query using your end-user credentials
  - Create a BigQuery ML connection to run the query using a service account

In most cases, you can use end-user credentials and leave the `  CONNECTION  ` argument blank. If your query job is expected to run for 48 hours or longer, you should use a BigQuery connection and include it in the `  CONNECTION  ` argument.

## Run generative AI queries with end-user credentials

To run generative AI queries using end-user credentials, configure the necessary permissions using the Google Cloud console. Note that if you are the project owner, you already have all the required permissions so you don't need to do anything.

### Required roles

To get the permissions that you need to run a query job that calls a Vertex AI model, ask your administrator to grant you the following IAM roles on the project:

  - Run query jobs: [BigQuery Job User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.jobUser) ( `  roles/bigquery.jobUser  ` )
  - Access a foundation model in Vertex AI: [Vertex AI User](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/aiplatform#aiplatform.user) ( `  roles/aiplatform.user  ` )

For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

You might also be able to get the required permissions through [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

### Grant the required roles to the user or group

You can use the Google Cloud console to grant the required roles for a principal. The principal is the user or group that runs the query that uses `  AI.*  ` functions to call a Vertex AI foundation model.

1.  In the Google Cloud console, go to the **IAM** page.

2.  Select your project.

3.  To grant roles to a principal:
    
    1.  Go to the **IAM & Admin** page.
    
    2.  Click person\_add **Grant access** .
        
        The **Add principals** dialog opens.
    
    3.  In the **New principals** field, enter the [principal identifier](/iam/docs/principal-identifiers) — for example, `  my-user@example.com  ` or `  //iam.googleapis.com/locations/global/workforcePools/example-pool/group/example-group@example.com  ` .
    
    4.  In the **Assign roles** section, for **Select a role** , click the drop-down arrow.
    
    5.  Search for the **Vertex AI User** role and select it.
    
    6.  Click **Add another role** .
    
    7.  In the **Assign roles** section, for **Select a role** , click the drop-down arrow.
    
    8.  Search for or browse to the **BigQuery Job User** role and select it.
    
    9.  Click **Save** .

To modify roles for a principal who already has roles on the project, see [Grant additional roles to the same principal](/iam/docs/grant-role-console#grant-other-roles) .

For information on other methods of granting project-level roles to a principal, see [Grant or revoke multiple IAM roles programmatically](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access#multiple-roles-programmatic) .

## Run generative AI queries with a BigQuery Connection

To run generative AI queries using a connection, create the connection, and then grant access to the service account created by the connection.

### Create a connection

You can set up a Cloud Resource Connection to run all generative AI queries that contain `  AI.*  ` functions. When you create a connection, you grant permissions to run queries to a service account.

Select one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the **BigQuery** page.

2.  In the left pane, click explore **Explorer** :
    
    If you don't see the left pane, click last\_page **Expand left pane** to open the pane.

3.  In the **Explorer** pane, expand your project name, and then click **Connections** .

4.  On the **Connections** page, click **Create connection** .

5.  For **Connection type** , choose **Vertex AI remote models, remote functions, BigLake and Spanner (Cloud Resource)** .

6.  In the **Connection ID** field, enter a name for your connection.

7.  For **Location type** , select a location for your connection. The connection should be colocated with your other resources such as datasets.

8.  Click **Create connection** .

9.  Click **Go to connection** .

10. In the **Connection info** pane, copy the service account ID for use in a later step.

### bq

1.  In a command-line environment, create a connection:
    
    ``` text
    bq mk --connection --location=REGION --project_id=PROJECT_ID \
        --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE CONNECTION_ID
    ```
    
    The `  --project_id  ` parameter overrides the default project.
    
    Replace the following:
    
      - `  REGION  ` : your [connection region](/bigquery/docs/locations#supported_locations)
      - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : your Google Cloud project ID
      - `  CONNECTION_ID  ` : an ID for your connection
    
    When you create a connection resource, BigQuery creates a unique system service account and associates it with the connection.
    
    **Troubleshooting** : If you get the following connection error, [update the Google Cloud SDK](/sdk/docs/quickstart) :
    
    ``` console
    Flags parsing error: flag --connection_type=CLOUD_RESOURCE: value should be one of...
    ```

2.  Retrieve and copy the service account ID for use in a later step:
    
    ``` text
    bq show --connection PROJECT_ID.REGION.CONNECTION_ID
    ```
    
    The output is similar to the following:
    
    ``` console
    name                          properties
    1234.REGION.CONNECTION_ID     {"serviceAccountId": "connection-1234-9u56h9@gcp-sa-bigquery-condel.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}
    ```

        print("Please use a different connection ID.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred while creating the connection: {e}")
```

### Node.js

Before trying this sample, follow the Node.js setup instructions in the [BigQuery quickstart using client libraries](/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-client-libraries) . For more information, see the [BigQuery Node.js API reference documentation](https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/bigquery/latest/index.html) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

``` javascript
const {ConnectionServiceClient} =
  require('@google-cloud/bigquery-connection').v1;
const {status} = require('@grpc/grpc-js');

const client = new ConnectionServiceClient();

/**

 */
async function createConnection(projectId, location, connectionId) {
  const parent = client.locationPath(projectId, location);

  const connection = {
    friendlyName: 'Example Connection',
    description: 'A sample connection for a Cloud Resource',
    // The service account for this cloudResource will be created by the API.
    // Its ID will be available in the response.

    if (err.code === status.ALREADY_EXISTS) {
      console.log(`Connection '${connectionId}' already exists.`);
    } else {
      console.error(`Error creating connection: ${err.message}`);
    }
  }
}
```

### Terraform

Use the [`  google_bigquery_connection  `](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/bigquery_connection) resource.

**Note:** To create BigQuery objects using Terraform, you must enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](/resource-manager/reference/rest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

The following example creates a Cloud resource connection named `  my_cloud_resource_connection  ` in the `  US  ` region:

``` terraform
# This queries the provider for project information.
data "google_project" "default" {}

# This creates a cloud resource connection in the US region named my_cloud_resource_connection.
# Note: The cloud resource nested object has only one output field - serviceAccountId.
resource "google_bigquery_connection" "default" {
  connection_id = "my_cloud_resource_connection"
  project       = data.google_project.default.project_id
  location      = "US"
  cloud_resource {}
}
```

To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.

## Prepare Cloud Shell

1.  Launch [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) .

2.  Set the default Google Cloud project where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
    
    You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
    
    ``` text
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PROJECT_ID
    ```
    
    Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform configuration file.

## Prepare the directory

Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also called a *root module* ).

1.  In [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) , create a directory and a new file within that directory. The filename must have the `  .tf  ` extension—for example `  main.tf  ` . In this tutorial, the file is referred to as `  main.tf  ` .
    
    ``` text
    mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
    ```

2.  If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
    
    Copy the sample code into the newly created `  main.tf  ` .
    
    Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.

3.  Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.

4.  Save your changes.

5.  Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
    
    ``` text
    terraform init
    ```
    
    Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the `  -upgrade  ` option:
    
    ``` text
    terraform init -upgrade
    ```

## Apply the changes

1.  Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or update match your expectations:
    
    ``` text
    terraform plan
    ```
    
    Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.

2.  Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering `  yes  ` at the prompt:
    
    ``` text
    terraform apply
    ```
    
    Wait until Terraform displays the "Apply complete\!" message.

3.  [Open your Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to view the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure that Terraform has created or updated them.

**Note:** Terraform samples typically assume that the required APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project.

For more information, see [Create and set up a Cloud resource connection](/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection) .

### Grant access to the service account

To run queries that use generative `  AI.*  ` functions that call Vertex AI models, you must grant appropriate permissions to the service account that was created when you created your connection. To run functions that call a Vertex AI foundation model, the [Vertex AI User role](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/aiplatform#aiplatform.user) ( `  roles/aiplatform.user  ` ) is required.

Select one of the following options:

### Console

1.  Go to the **IAM & Admin** page.

2.  Click person\_add **Grant access** .
    
    The **Add principals** dialog opens.

3.  In the **New principals** field, enter the service account ID that you copied earlier.

4.  In the **Assign roles** section, click **Add roles** .

5.  Search for the **Vertex AI User** role, select it, and then click **Apply** .

6.  Click **Save** .

### gcloud

Use the [`  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding  ` command](/sdk/gcloud/reference/projects/add-iam-policy-binding) :

``` text
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
--member="serviceAccount:$(bq show --format=prettyjson --connection $PROJECT_ID.$REGION.$CONNECTION_ID | jq -r .cloudResource.serviceAccountId)"
--role=roles/aiplatform.user
```

Replace the following:

  - `  PROJECT_ID  ` : the name of your project.
  - `  REGION  ` : the location where the connection was created.
  - `  CONNECTION_ID  ` : The name of the connection you created.

### Terraform

Use the [`  google_bigquery_connection  `](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/bigquery_connection) resource.

**Note:** To create BigQuery objects using Terraform, you must enable the [Cloud Resource Manager API](/resource-manager/reference/rest) .

To authenticate to BigQuery, set up Application Default Credentials. For more information, see [Set up authentication for client libraries](/bigquery/docs/authentication#client-libs) .

The following example grants IAM role access to the service account of the Cloud resource connection:

``` terraform
# This queries the provider for project information.
data "google_project" "default" {}

# This creates a cloud resource connection in the US region named my_cloud_resource_connection.
# Note: The cloud resource nested object has only one output field - serviceAccountId.
resource "google_bigquery_connection" "default" {
  connection_id = "my_cloud_resource_connection"
  project       = data.google_project.default.project_id
  location      = "US"
  cloud_resource {}
}

## This grants IAM role access to the service account of the connection created in the previous step.
resource "google_project_iam_member" "connectionPermissionGrant" {
  project = data.google_project.default.project_id
  role    = "roles/storage.objectViewer"
  member  = "serviceAccount:${google_bigquery_connection.default.cloud_resource[0].service_account_id}"
}
```

To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the following sections.

## Prepare Cloud Shell

1.  Launch [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) .

2.  Set the default Google Cloud project where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
    
    You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
    
    ``` text
    export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=PROJECT_ID
    ```
    
    Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform configuration file.

## Prepare the directory

Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also called a *root module* ).

1.  In [Cloud Shell](https://shell.cloud.google.com/) , create a directory and a new file within that directory. The filename must have the `  .tf  ` extension—for example `  main.tf  ` . In this tutorial, the file is referred to as `  main.tf  ` .
    
    ``` text
    mkdir DIRECTORY && cd DIRECTORY && touch main.tf
    ```

2.  If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
    
    Copy the sample code into the newly created `  main.tf  ` .
    
    Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.

3.  Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.

4.  Save your changes.

5.  Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
    
    ``` text
    terraform init
