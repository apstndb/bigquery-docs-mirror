# Table decorators in legacy SQL

**Caution:** This document describes table decorators in legacy SQL query syntax. The preferred query syntax for BigQuery is GoogleSQL. Standard SQL does not support table decorators, but the [`  FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#for_system_time_as_of) clause in GoogleSQL provides functionality equivalent to time decorators. For range decorators, you can achieve similar semantics in GoogleSQL by using time-partitioned tables. For more information, see [Table decorators](/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/migrating-from-legacy-sql#table_decorators) in the GoogleSQL migration guide.

Normally, BigQuery performs a full column scan when [running a query](/bigquery/docs/running-queries) . You can use table decorators in legacy SQL to perform a more cost-effective query of a subset of your data. Table decorators can be used whenever a table is read, such as when copying a table, [exporting a table](/bigquery/docs/export-intro) , or listing data using `  tabledata.list  ` .

**Note:** Range decorators aren't supported in GoogleSQL. To view the status of this feature request, see the [BigQuery feature request tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35905931) .

Table decorators support relative and absolute `  <time>  ` values. Relative values are indicated by a negative number, and absolute values are indicated by a positive number. For example, `  -3600000  ` indicates one hour ago in milliseconds, relative to the current time; `  3600000  ` indicates one hour in milliseconds after 1/1/1970.

## Time decorators

Time decorators (formerly known as *snapshot decorators* ) reference a table's historical data at a point in time.

### Syntax

``` text
@<time>
```

  - References a table's historical data at `  <time>  ` , in milliseconds since the epoch.
  - `  <time>  ` must be within the last seven days and greater than or equal to the table's creation time, but less than the table's deletion or expiration time.
  - `  @0  ` is a special case that references the oldest data available for the table.

Time decorators are also used outside of legacy SQL. You can use them in the [`  bq cp  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_cp) to [restore deleted tables](/bigquery/docs/restore-deleted-tables) within seven days of table deletion.

### Examples

To get the historical data for a table at one hour ago:

**Relative value example**

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE@-3600000]
```

**Absolute value example**

1.  Get `  <time>  ` for one hour ago:
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT INTEGER(DATE_ADD(USEC_TO_TIMESTAMP(NOW()), -1, 'HOUR')/1000)
    ```

2.  Then, replace `  <time>  ` in the following query:
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE@time]
    ```

## Range decorators

### Syntax

``` text
@<time1>-<time2>
```

  - References table data added between `  <time1>  ` and `  <time2>  ` , in milliseconds since the epoch.
  - `  <time1>  ` and `  <time2>  ` must be within the last seven days.
  - `  <time2>  ` is optional and defaults to 'now'.

### Examples

**Relative value examples**

To get table data added between one hour and half an hour ago:

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE@-3600000--1800000]
```

To get data from the last 10 minutes:

``` text
#legacySQL
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE@-600000-]
```

**Absolute value example**

To get table data added between one hour and half an hour ago:

1.  Get `  <time1>  ` for one hour ago:
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT INTEGER(DATE_ADD(USEC_TO_TIMESTAMP(NOW()), -1, 'HOUR')/1000)
    ```

2.  Get `  <time2>  ` for a half hour ago:
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT INTEGER(DATE_ADD(USEC_TO_TIMESTAMP(NOW()), -30, 'MINUTE')/1000)
    ```

3.  Replace `  <time1>  ` and `  <time2>  ` in the following query:
    
    ``` text
    #legacySQL
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [PROJECT_ID:DATASET.TABLE@time1-time2]
    ```
