## Limitations

Facebook Ads data transfers are subject to the following limitations:

  - The minimum interval time between recurring Facebook Ads data transfers is 24 hours. The default interval for a recurring data transfer is 24 hours.

  - The BigQuery Data Transfer Service for Facebook Ads only supports a fixed set of tables. Custom reports aren't supported.

  - Facebook Ads data transfers have a maximum duration of six hours. A transfer fails if it takes longer than this maximum duration.

  - Incremental transfers aren't supported for `  AdInsights  ` and `  AdInsightsActions  ` tables. When you create a data transfer that includes `  AdInsights  ` and `  AdInsightsActions  ` tables, and you specified a date in **Schedule options** , all data that is available for that date is transferred.

  - The BigQuery Data Transfer Service supports a refresh window of up to 30 days to the `  AdInsights  ` and `  AdInsightsActions  ` tables. The refresh window refers to the number of days that a data transfer will retrieve source data from. When you run a data transfer for the first time, the data transfer retrieves all source data available within the refresh window.

  - The long-lived user access token that is required for Facebook Ads transfers expires after 60 days.
    
    If your long-lived user access token is expired, you can obtain the new one by navigating to your data transfer details and clicking **Edit** . In the edit transfer page, follow the same steps in [Facebook Ads prerequisites](#fb_ads_prereqs) to generate a new long-lived user access token.

  - To use a network attachment with this data transfer, you must first [create a network attachment by defining a static IP address](/bigquery/docs/connections-with-network-attachment) .

  - If your configured network attachment and virtual machine (VM) instance are located in different regions, there might be cross-region data movement when you transfer data from Facebook Ads.

## Data ingestion from Facebook Ads transfers

When you transfer data from Facebook Ads into BigQuery, the data is loaded into BigQuery tables that are partitioned by date. The table partition that the data is loaded into corresponds to the date from the data source. If you schedule multiple transfers for the same date, BigQuery Data Transfer Service overwrites the partition for that specific date with the latest data. Multiple transfers in the same day or running backfills don't result in duplicate data, and partitions for other dates are not affected.

For `  AdInsights  ` and `  AdInsightsActions  ` tables, the table partition that the data is loaded into corresponds to the date from the data source.

For `  AdAccounts  ` tables, snapshots are taken once a day and stored in the partition of the last transfer run date. The refresh window does not apply to the `  AdAccounts  ` table.

### Refresh windows

A *refresh window* is the number of days that a data transfer retrieves data when a data transfer occurs. For example, if the refresh window is three days and a daily transfer occurs, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service retrieves all data from your source table from the past three days. In this example, when a daily transfer occurs, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service creates a new BigQuery destination table partition with a copy of your source table data from the current day, then automatically triggers backfill runs to update the BigQuery destination table partitions with your source table data from the past two days. The automatically triggered backfill runs will either overwrite or incrementally update your BigQuery destination table, depending on whether or not incremental updates are supported in the BigQuery Data Transfer Service connector.

When you run a data transfer for the first time, the data transfer retrieves all source data available within the refresh window. For example, if the refresh window is three days and you run the data transfer for the first time, the BigQuery Data Transfer Service retrieves all source data within three days.

To retrieve data outside the refresh window, such as historical data, or to recover data from any transfer outages or gaps, you can initiate or schedule a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .

## Before you begin

The following sections describe the steps that you need to take before you create a Facebook Ads data transfer.

### Facebook Ads prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following Facebook Ads information when creating a Facebook Ads data transfer.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Facebook Ads parameters</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       clientID      </code></td>
<td>The app ID name for the OAuth 2.0 client.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       clientSecret      </code></td>
<td>The app secret for the OAuth 2.0 client.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code dir="ltr" translate="no">       refreshToken      </code></td>
<td>The long-lived user access token, also known as a <em>refresh</em> token.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

To obtain a `  clientID  ` and `  clientSecret  ` , perform the following steps:

1.  [Create a Facebook developer app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/other-app-types) with the app type `  Business  ` .
2.  In the [Facebook App dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) , click **App Settings** \> **Basic** and find the app ID and app secret that correspond to the app.

To obtain a long-lived user access token, also known as a *refresh* token, perform the following steps:

1.  In the Google Cloud console, proceed with the steps to [create a Facebook Ads transfer](#fb_ads_transfer_setup) .

2.  In the **Data Source Details** section, copy the redirect URI listed after the **Refresh Token** field.

3.  Click the [Facebook App dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) , then click **Set up** in the **Facebook login for Business** section.

4.  In the **Settings** page, enter the redirect URL in the **Valid OAuth Redirect URIs** field and click **Save** .

5.  Return to the Google Cloud console. In the **Data Source Details** section, click **Authorize** . You will be redirected to a Facebook authentication page.

6.  Select the Facebook developer app to authorize the account that connects with the BigQuery Data Transfer Service.

7.  Once complete, click **Got it** to return to the Google Cloud console. The long-lived user access token is now populated in the transfer configuration.

Long-lived user access tokens expire after 60 days. For information on how to obtain a new long-lived user access token, see [Limitations](#limitations) .

#### Refresh token alternatives

Alternatively, you can provide a refresh token when you [create a data transfer](#fb_ads_transfer_setup) if you have obtained one using one of the following methods:

  - [Generate a long-lived user access token using the Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens/get-long-lived) . The `  ads_management  ` , `  ads_read  ` , and `  business_management  ` permissions are required for a valid token for the data transfer.
  - [Generate a system user token](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/access-tokens) . A system user token lets you manually add assets, such as ad accounts, to be included in the data transfer. If a system user token is expired, you must manually update the transfer configuration with new credentials. You also have the option to create a token that doesn't expire when you create a system user token. For more information, see [Supported access tokens](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/facebook-login-for-business#supported-access-tokens) .

### BigQuery prerequisites

  - Verify that you have completed all actions required to [enable the BigQuery Data Transfer Service](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service) .
  - [Create a BigQuery dataset](/bigquery/docs/datasets) to store your data.
  - If you intend to set up transfer run notifications for Pub/Sub, ensure that you have the `  pubsub.topics.setIamPolicy  ` Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission. If you only set up email notifications, Pub/Sub permissions aren't required. For more information, see [BigQuery Data Transfer Service run notifications](/bigquery/docs/transfer-run-notifications) .

### Required BigQuery roles

To get the permissions that you need to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer, ask your administrator to grant you the [BigQuery Admin](/iam/docs/roles-permissions/bigquery#bigquery.admin) ( `  roles/bigquery.admin  ` ) IAM role on your project. For more information about granting roles, see [Manage access to projects, folders, and organizations](/iam/docs/granting-changing-revoking-access) .

This predefined role contains the permissions required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer. To see the exact permissions that are required, expand the **Required permissions** section:

#### Required permissions

The following permissions are required to create a BigQuery Data Transfer Service data transfer:

  - BigQuery Data Transfer Service permissions:
      - `  bigquery.transfers.update  `
      - `  bigquery.transfers.get  `
  - BigQuery permissions:
      - `  bigquery.datasets.get  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.update  `
      - `  bigquery.datasets.setIamPolicy  `
      - `  bigquery.jobs.create  `

You might also be able to get these permissions with [custom roles](/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles) or other [predefined roles](/iam/docs/roles-overview#predefined) .

For more information, see [Grant `  bigquery.admin  ` access](/bigquery/docs/enable-transfer-service#grant_bigqueryadmin_access) .

<td>Ad insights actions report for all ad accounts.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### bq

Enter the [`  bq mk  ` command](/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference#bq_mk) and supply the transfer creation flag `  --transfer_config  ` :

``` text
bq mk
    --transfer_config
    --project_id=PROJECT_ID
    --data_source=DATA_SOURCE
    --display_name=DISPLAY_NAME
    --target_dataset=DATASET
    --params=&#39;PARAMETERS'
```

Where:

  - PROJECT\_ID (optional): your Google Cloud project ID. If `  --project_id  ` isn't supplied to specify a particular project, the default project is used.
  - DATA\_SOURCE : the data source (for example, `  facebook-ads  ` ).
  - DISPLAY\_NAME : the display name for the data transfer configuration. The transfer name can be any value that lets you identify the transfer if you need to modify it later.
  - DATASET : the target dataset for the data transfer configuration.
  - PARAMETERS : the parameters for the created data transfer configuration in JSON format. For example: `  --params='{"param":"param_value"}'  ` . The following are the parameters for a Facebook Ads transfer:
      - `  connector.authentication.oauth.clientId  ` : The app ID name for the OAuth 2.0 client.
      - `  connector.authentication.oauth.clientSecret  ` : The app secret for the OAuth 2.0 client.
      - `  connector.authentication.oauth.refreshToken  ` : The long-lived token ID.
      - `  connector.authorizedAdAccountsOnly  ` : If set to `  true  ` , the connector only retrieves data from advertising accounts that are authorized to your Facebook App. You can find your authorized advertising accounts under **App Settings** \> **Advanced** , and in the **Advanced accounts** section.
      - `  connector.actionCollections  ` : Action collections are objects that specify the different types of actions people have taken in response to your ad. For a full list of `  actionCollections  ` values, see [Action collections](#action_collections) .
          - For more information, see [Ad Insights](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/adgroup/insights) .
      - `  connector.genericBreakdowns  ` : Specify the generic breakdowns for your insights data. These breakdowns determine how your transferred data is organized in the `  AdInsights  ` and `  AdInsightsActions  ` tables. Facebook Ads only permits certain combinations of breakdowns. For more information about permitted breakdown combinations, see [Combining breakdowns](#combining_breakdowns) .
      - `  actionBreakdowns  ` : Specify the action breakdowns for your insights data. These breakdowns determine how your transferred data is organized in the `  AdInsights  ` and `  AdInsightsActions  ` tables. For information about combining breakdowns, see [Combining breakdowns](#combining_breakdowns) .

For example, the following command creates a Facebook Ads data transfer in the default project with all the required parameters:

``` text
bq mk
--transfer_config
--target_dataset=mydataset
--data_source=facebook_ads
--display_name='My Transfer'
--params='{"connector.authentication.oauth.clientId": "1650000000",
    "connector.authentication.oauth.clientSecret":"TBA99550",
    "connector.authentication.oauth.refreshToken":"abcdef",
    "connector.authorizedAdAccountsOnly":true,
    "connector.actionCollections":["Actions", "Conversions"],
    "connector.genericBreakdowns":["PublisherPlatform", "PlatformPosition"],
    "connector.actionBreakdowns":["ActionDevice", "ActionType"]}'
```

### API

Use the [`  projects.locations.transferConfigs.create  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs/create) method and supply an instance of the [`  TransferConfig  `](/bigquery/docs/reference/datatransfer/rest/v1/projects.locations.transferConfigs#TransferConfig) resource.

When you save the transfer configuration, the Facebook Ads connector automatically triggers a transfer run according to your schedule option. With every transfer run, the Facebook Ads connector transfers all available data from Facebook Ads into BigQuery.

To manually run a data transfer outside of your regular schedule, you can start a [backfill run](/bigquery/docs/working-with-transfers#manually_trigger_a_transfer) .

For information on how your transferred data maps to Meta API fields, see [Facebook Ads report transformation](/bigquery/docs/facebook-ads-transformation) .

## Action collections

Action collections are objects that specify the different types of actions people have taken in response to your ad. You can specify action collections when you [set up your transfer configuration](#fb_ads_transfer_setup) .

Action collections represent the fields of the [`  list<AdsActionStats>  ` type](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ads-action-stats/) that are present in the [`  Ad Account, Insights  ` endpoint response](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-account/insights/) .

When a transfer completes, these action collections are populated in the [`  AdInsightsActions  ` table](/bigquery/docs/facebook-ads-transformation#adinsightsactions_report) .

**Caution:** The more action collections that you specify for a transfer, the more likely you will [reach the rate limits imposed by Facebook Ads](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/overview/rate-limiting) .

The following is a list of action collections supported in a Facebook Ads data transfer:

  - `  ActionValues  `
  - `  Actions  `
  - `  AdClickActions  `
  - `  AdImpressionActions  `
  - `  CatalogSegmentActions  `
  - `  CatalogSegmentValue  `
  - `  CatalogSegmentValueMobilePurchaseRoas  `
  - `  CatalogSegmentValueOmniPurchaseRoas  `
  - `  CatalogSegmentValueWebsitePurchaseRoas  `
  - `  ConversionValues  `
  - `  Conversions  `

  - `  VideoPlayCurveActions  `
  - `  VideoPlayRetentionGraphActions  `
  - `  VideoTimeWatchedActions  `
  - `  WebsiteCtr  `
  - `  WebsitePurchaseRoas  `

## Combining breakdowns

Facebook Ads has restrictions on what columns can be selected together. Using these restricted combinations will cause the data transfer to fail.

For more information about what breakdowns can be combined, see [Combining Breakdowns](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/insights/breakdowns/#combiningbreakdowns) .

## Troubleshoot transfer configuration

If you are having issues setting up a Facebook Ads data transfer, try the following troubleshooting steps:

  - Check if your user access token has expired using the [Facebook Access Token Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/accesstoken/) . Long-lived user access tokens expire after 60 days. If your long-lived user access token has expired, navigate to your transfer details then click **Edit** to modify your transfer configuration. In the edit transfer page, follow the same steps in [Facebook Ads prerequisites](#fb_ads_prereqs) to generate a new one.

  - Check that the long-lived user access token is generated with the required permissions - `  ads_management  ` , `  ads_read  ` , and `  business_management  ` . You can check the permissions on your long-lived user access token by entering the following link into your browser:
    
    ``` text
    https://graph.facebook.com/me/permissions?access_token=TOKEN
    ```
    
    Where TOKEN is the value of the long-lived user access token.
    
    If you don't have the required permissions, generate a new long-lived user access token by following the steps in [Facebook Ads prerequisites](#fb_ads_prereqs) .

  - Check the **Required Actions** tab on the [Facebook App dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) for any items that require attention.

You might encounter the following error messages related to Meta API rate limit errors:

  - Error: `  There have been too many calls from this ad-account. Wait a bit and try again.  `  
    **Resolution** : Check that there are no parallel workflows using the same apps or credentials. If these errors persist, try upgrading your permissions to **Advanced Access** to get more rate limiting quota. For more information, see [Marketing API Rate Limiting](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/rate-limiting/) .

### Common monitoring metrics messages

You can also check the [BigQuery Data Transfer Service monitoring metrics](/bigquery/docs/dts-monitor#monitor) to determine the cause of a data transfer failure. The following table lists some common `  ERROR_CODE  ` messages for Facebook Ads data transfers.
